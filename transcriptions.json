    "transcript": "A polar bear stands in the desert by Don Canal, an Arctic-burned 505.  The relationship that humans have with animals is profound.  Animals figure prominently in human evolution.  Yet in the modern world, animals can become invisible, and humans may easily forget the  necessity of our relationship to them.  By creating monumental sculptures, the artist hopes to make animals visible and to bring  particular species into human consciousness.  In polar bear, recycled carhoods become flexible slabs of steel.  These are bolted to a steel frame that defines the surface of the 34-foot polar bear.  The polar bear has come to witness the burning desert.  She has a message for the humans, taking the long view is crucial to our survival.  How far into the future are we willing to consider the impact of our actions?  The long view allows us to accept responsibility for the actions we take today, actions that  will have impact decades or centuries into the future.",

Oh, shut the fuck up with you, mate.  Back in 1927, I had a little farm and I called it heaven.  Prices up and rain come down and I hold my crops all in the town.  I got the money.  Bought clothes and groceries.  Fed the kids.  Took it easy.  The rain it quit and the wind got high.  The black old dust storms filled the sky.  And I'll swap my farm for a Ford machine.  And I filled it full of this gas.  I lean and start it.  Rollin' in it.  Twistin' the California.  Way up yonder on a mountain road.  I had a hot motor and a heavy load.  As it goin' pretty fast.  I wasn't even stoppin' eyes about to nothin' down.  Like popcorn, a puffin' had to break down.  Sort of a nervous bust down of the...  mechanism there as I'm kinda in giant trouble.  His way up yonder on a mountain road.  I wasn't feeling so very good.  And I give this rollin' for to shove.  And I was a gon' coast as far as it could.  I'm instant rolling.  Takin' up speed and there was a hairpin' turn.  And I couldn't make it.  Land alive and I'm a tellin' you.  The fiddles and the guitars really flew.  That Ford took off like a flying squirrel.  And it flew halfway around the world.  It scared our wives and childrens.  All outside of that now.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  This dusty old dust is a blowin' me home.  I've got to be rolling along.  I'll sing this song, but I'll sing it again.

So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  This dusty old dust is a blowin' me home.  I've got to be drifting along.  Anyway, like I told you, the old dust storm hit there.  These people all congregated in their little houses.  And in the room in the house that I was in,  there was 12 or 15 people.  And the power was there.  Telling each other so long it's been good to know you.  Dusty old dust is a blowin' me home.  And I ain't got long to stay.  I've got to be drifting along.  Well, here's what happened.  The telephone rang and it jumped off the wall.  That was the preacher paying his call.  He said, look at the shape that the world is in.  I've got to cut price on salvation and sin.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  Dusty old dust is a blowin' me home.  And I ain't got to be drifting along.  The church houses were jammed and packed.  People were sent from front to the back.  It was a dusty.  The preacher couldn't read his text.  So he folded his specs and it took up collections.  And so long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.

    "transcript": "Like four, what do you want to say here?  Let me pop you up here.  I had something I wanted to come up in.  I wanted to read for, actually, a few different years,  something I've written.  So it's really kind of, it's interesting,  because I haven't really got a perspective on it  until now, but I guess you could kind of call it a review.  This kind of my perspective from burning from 2011  up until 2016.  All right, well, what's your name?  Let's start with your name.  My name's Nate.  Nate.  Or Yoda here on plan.  Yoda on plan.  Well, go ahead, if it's not going to take too long, go ahead.  Yoda, everyone, Yoda.  All right, so I just wanted to kind of basically  as my experience from when I started burning in 2008, 2008,  but my experience from 2011, I mean,  the theme back in 2011 was right to passage.  And the man for the first time that year  was had the legs spread and taking one step  from one pyramid to another.  And this was done personally for me by the creators,  because the Burning Man organization applied for them  to be a nonprofit organization.  It was literally their own right of passage.  Simultaneously, the events sold out for the first time.  Circle of regional efficacies as well  that was picked the regions of the world  to have burner culture to come to the playa  and build an effigy to burn it on playa Thursday night  to be the largest burn in the world.  2011 core projects were united regions of burners  who were neighbors, but never knew.  The lottery was put in place much like a youth  turning to an adult in a tribe  being cast out of the privilege of being provided for it.  But they had to hunt out their own ticket  and gain their right to participate in the community.  The playa was riddled with first time burners  and the city experienced congestion and challenges  they'd never faced before.  And then it was a complete realized right of passage  by every participant.  In 2012, you had this theme of fertility.  And that was the thing that was really weird at all,  because often nine o'clock plus the theme cams,  all of the male centered interests,  while three o'clock plus the theme cams  were all female centered interests.  And I think to myself in this place  is like a Vitruvian man.  It's the Burning Man symbol.  From 10 and 2, it cuts through the man to the center  to create the arms and legs and the diamond to the deep playa  is the head, the temple is the 12 o'clock us.  We all exit out of the way that we entered through the groin  at six o'clock and rebirth back into the new world.  Now back to touch in 2013 in the theme  is cargo cults.  So it's about humans that were never touched by modern day,  by modern day man.  But they met soldiers in the world war  that viewed them as gods by dropping cargo from the sky  and being able to call flying machines  and beasts from the sky.  So no, so the event asked on our tickets,  who's John from, where are they really from?  And how can we, where is planet Earth going  on this existence?  Here's the thing.  The eye answered is John from, came from the soldiers.  John was the most common name, American name,  and they introduced themselves high on John from Los Angeles,  New York, Boston, Chicago.  But to them, it was all the same person  in separate bodies, or as a god.  In that year, the man burned asking three questions,  which were those.  So the cohesion of the three is that Black Rock City  received a massive indoctrination of secular religion.  So I think I've felt for the last three years  leading up to that point.  But now, religions, as set of rules, regulations,  and guidelines for spiritual principles and practices,  what's this new religion believes in is the individual.  When we believe in ourselves, it's  seemingly impossible, it becomes attainable.  The god, or higher power, or deity,  or effect of being outside of us,  is revealed to us in our everyday lives,  and we're empowered to follow our passions  of what our existence tells us to do.  And Black Rock City showed me that every role and position  has a place in a person with a passion to do it.  In society, we're forced against our wills  of their passions, to fill others' needs  in order to achieve their own passions.  That is, but here we're now.  We've always had the choice.  We've only just walked out of Socrates,  came to realize that when we pursue our passions,  we allow others to buy opening the space  that we occupy while in wait.  So where are we going, you ask?  Well, we're moving forward towards our true potential,  the flow, the optimal experience, as a race each of us,  each of us find our passions.  They ship Earth will not physically land anywhere.  They land on a new philosophical value that will allow us  what our chemical drives have always been leading us to.  A complete cohesion of existence  and coalescing of good and bad into a non-duistic being.  We all recreate and reinvent the God,  or higher power, or deity, in our own image as a planet.  Our own immaculate birth, so to speak.  So in one sentence, we end up writing  the big book in our own lives.  Now, what I really felt last year, what that year  was growing out, is outgrowing itself,  and the organization, and for the first time,  anyone international had a home base for people  from their countries.  Once again, leaving with more neighbors back home  than when we actually came with.  Last year was the first time I actually asked someone  in 20, that was in 2013.  So how many times have you been to the burn?  There's actually, yeah, it's my third time,  but my first time here.  So it started to sink in.  The community and the desert was no longer limited  to the confines of the playa.  The regionals had been pushed because they'd gotten too big  for it, just like it did at Baker Beach.  In 2013, the base was a flying saucer  with the core effigies grouped in four segments,  being in the four corners of the world.  So it refers back to the world wars,  drawing all dropping cargo in one place,  or take its red route, we will return.  I can't help but feel as though we were in a space  we called home, but suddenly felt as though  we'd been cast out of the way.  There's no cohesive feeling for the event I used to know.  So where were we doing out here in the desert  awaiting salvation?  Possibly abduction?  The abduction that occurred was in the frame of mind.  There's definitely a stagnant experience in that year  that we are going through the motions  awaiting the magic that we once be held.  When we were overtook a speculation  and concerned for where our values were leading our source  to a greater level of being,  we were no longer home, but alienated from the sessence.  In 2014, could air a vancery?  The man who had no base, core effigies were all suke.  The interactive gifting marketplace,  which will undoubtedly in my perspective  then would cause resentments in veterans causing them  to never really want to come back.  What are you talking about trying to sell something here?  The base was the man, but the base of the man was the suke.  The organization granted their wish,  was granted their wish and established their nonprofit status  that year.  They can no longer fund themselves,  but they could fund the regions.  In literal terms, the regions held the event up.  The man burning with the suke is the cohesion  of the event with the regions, all burning it once this year.  So if the organization is burning the event in order  for all of us to keep it because it fostered us meeting  together to create the very thing back home.  Number one virtue from 2014 was a gift is not something  that's wanted, it's something that's needed.  The public outrage over will chase this retraction  of the statement of the organization's profits  reminded me of a girl in the suko I named that year.  She was angry when I used the random plan named Generator  and I named her Dusty Wad and asked why it was so crappy.  I suddenly felt how her parents felt.  But I told her, that's what happens when you buy wholesale.  You get exactly what you pay for her.  And that's the thing is that we're all looking for someone  to fix this thing and it's up to us.  It's always been us.  And this is the gift that we've actually been needing.  The solution is the person next to us.  We need more people involved in order for a global connection  into happen as the orgas can support and flourish.  We're a mental and physical shareholders of the playa  when we're out here and we need to start acting  like instead of some trust fund kid you got burned  by the broker on the stock market.  It's not all over.  But this is the very act that started the event  in a larger and more eloquent way.  Larry Harvey burned a man on the beach.  Let go of a love they knew of being the beloved vent of 2013.  Only this time the man he burned is the event  in order to let go of the old frame of the event  and shift this overgrowth that makes that thing  in the desert an exclusive event  into an inclusive global community.  The 2011 core projects he started uniting regions  of burners who were neighbors but never knew.  Their rights of passage were for the first time  on their own making sure they got a ticket.  Instead of their parents cutting them off  and allowing us in 2012 we were fertility.  We were pollinating the globe with our culture  with one simple concise idea  similar to a hive mind effort.  In 2013 we were cargo cultists.  We continued to these traditions and rituals  that once brought unimaginable illumination  and hopes that would return and they would be among the magic  with our tickets reading and they will return.  In 2015 the years carnival of mirrors  and I'm hoping that in that year  we can all reflect on the communities  that we've built, the things that we've lost  and we've learned most of all the friends  that we've made in the communities that we've built.  We're all authors and we all wrote this in ourselves  into this book.  I'm hoping we see the reflections that of the magic  and the light and every one of us  have connected ourselves and make this new level of awareness  of what we've learned last and have achieved.  This new chapter of burning and burn our own men  in our own communities that we've created ourselves.  It's the one gift the organization leaves us  in the infrastructure to do it your own way  like they always have on the playa every year.  So in 2015 there was three questions on the ticket  just like in 2013.  It was who is the trickster, who's being tricked  and how might we discover who we are.  So these words would be kept in mind during the event  but the first question here is who's the trickster.  This question implies that there is a trickster  at the event we're all in one the same.  So simplify it a little bit.  If you ever looked yourself in the mirror  and wondered who that person is,  in most people's mind, they may feel tricked by their eyes  or senses based off the idea that they had themselves.  So when we see something that is us  but does not appear to be the same substantiation  feeling tricked is a definite perception.  So asking who is this trickster  may be a question of who are you?  Being a carnival of mirrors when we look at our reflection  and we see ourselves other than what we thought we were,  we experienced a separation of self.  One side is the perception of self  and the other side is the sense of self.  These two versions of us are both of us  but now the independent from the other  is brought to a conscious level.  This is one of both sides of the perception  start to ask the second question.  Who is being tricked?  This question implies that there's a deception going on  is my perception of self-tricking me into thinking  I look different than I do  or is my sense of self-tricking me into thinking  the person before me is myself.  Basically the difference between therefore I am I exist  or I exist therefore I am  or applied to the current affairs of burning culture  I am a burner therefore I exist  which exists on the playa  or I exist therefore I am a burner  which is the existence of the regionals.  So once we've arrived this double-ended question  the last question can be asked in the right context.  How might we discover who we are?  We're all a reflection of the Vitruvian man  I spoke of before came to fruition  is the centerpiece of the event.  Da Vinci is known as a man who's never finished  the work that he ever started  which is a behavior that was prevalent across the playa that year.  The man was not finished until Wednesday.  There's controversy over the money spent over a transport  of its 747 on playa to a giant dance floor  which flying machine mind you.  There's blatant sabotage of a massive theme camp  that gained notoriety of against the grain behavior  they had established towards the 10 principles of the event.  There's a lot of ambition in this year  that year and personally I feel I set a lot of people up  for disappointment in what they had set out to achieve  but as always the playa provides and we were shown  what all what hard work was.  Regardless of setbacks, regardless of heartache and disdain  we were shown what is truly important  and all of our efforts we look forward as them  as successes or failures all impacts the masses.  This year that year was about invention, innovation  and we look at them and study to uphold the principles  and communicate them to the newcomer.  I know showing up this year with a mission,  a golden goose or at least under the masses  that was definitely something I came with.  The only thing I can close with with this  from what I've gained from this year burning.  If you were here last year and you saw the base of the man  and you walked into the base of this year  there was a major similarity  and I feel like there was definitely a memorial  not only for Larry Harvey but what I haven't last year.  And the interesting thing is from the outside of the man base  it's just a giant circuit board, it's a wall  and what it turned into night was a natural firewall  and it's the same thing where the media  turns a lot of what happens out here  into something that it's not  and it's the only thing that anyone that doesn't come here  out here with you will ask you about  but what actually stays inside here is actual true meaning  and feeling and it's something that only all of us know  by being here.  That's what I got for you guys, thank you.  Nate, that was, that was pretty amazing.  I worked on the man base and so I'm like very connected  to what you're talking about with regards  to the evolution of the man base, Larry's themes,  the city and the community.  I feel there's definitely a common response that happens there.  It's a much bigger picture that you're looking at  and now you've just woken everyone up to see your bigger picture  and that's a bigger picture that I as a 18th year burner  definitely look at every day.",

    "transcript": "So, uh, we've got an important message here, um, um, this is really sad that we actually  haven't even talked about it, but, uh, there you go. So, destruction of art is not participation,  and it's not radical self-expression. It's vandalism, and it's not tolerated in Black Rock City,  plain and simple. This week, the beloved art installation, Paraluna, was carelessly destroyed.  Also, one of the ice sheep was stolen. These are works that took the artist months to conceptualize  plan, transport, and construct all for the enjoyment of Burning Man participants. Breaking someone's  art isn't funny, and stealing art is not a prank. There's nothing playful or clever about  destroying an artist's work and property, and it discourages them from continuing to contribute  to our city again. If you see something, say something to the people doing it or inform a Black Rock  Ranger, and if you can't or want respect the art, then don't come to Black Rock City.",

I always get the year wrong Bob, correct me, 2004.  No idea.  It might be three, but three, four, whatever. A lot of freaking times what I'm saying people. And you have heard his voice on air and you've felt a spirit on air. And those of you know him, know that again he's burning man on legs. And what he's done for the radio station.  Well, you know, I do nothing for this.  You know what I'm sorry.  You ever see the movie called Wagged The Dog?  I've seen Wagged The Dog.  He's like, I'm a producer. You put me in a room full of talented people. I can make things happen.  Yes.  I personally have no talent.  Oh, please.  No, my talent is putting people together and making them all move forward.  It's one of your talents.  We have fabulous, fabulous DJs here.  We do.  We're far more coherent.  Nice, baby.  I can't do what they do.  I can't do what next does.  He's our sound engineer.  I can't do what Mark Chang does.  He's our F guy.  But Bob, not putting together a team.  That's my talent.  I put together.  But haven't you done basically all of that in the past?  No.  I've watched you table the station.  Absolutely not.  I've watched you table the station.  I just passed these things together to hope that it fucking works.  These two humble people.  I can't do what they do.  And it's a collaborative effort.  Of course it is.  I'm not saying you do it all.  But I'm saying you could do it all if you had to.  And you would.  You would.  You would because you're driving your passenger journey.  I would, I would patch together my best efforts.  And it would be sweet.  But you're right.  The crew here are the, one of Bob's magic superstitions.  But I really know what I'm doing.  And I want to, I want to do it better.  So I, I get a team.  Mm-hmm.  And you have evolved this team in a brilliant way,  where everything is right better than it would be.  And now the time has come.  But wasn't it much more fun was just three of us?  Wasn't that so cool working 18 hours a day?  I remember that.  Yeah.  There was no BMIR camp.  No.  There's a little tiny radio station.  That's right.  That's right.  No one would go in the air before 90 am or after 2 am.  Except for you.  Well, one day I said, well, it's just freaking go in the air.  Yes.  Right.  It's time's available.  Right.  I remember that well.  But you're, but I want to affirm that people,  like one of Bob's greatest superhero talents is connecting people.  And that's an important skill for any leader  and Bob has done it brilliantly.  And he will be missed.  But he won't be missed because he'll be here.  I don't mean maybe physically here,  but he will be there.  We'll be back in a couple years.  But Bob, thank you for what you've done.  And again, the last thing I'll say,  maybe the last thing is that people who know you know your spirit,  your drive, your passion, your brilliance, and your heart.  And what I love about you on AirBob  is I think even people that don't know you feel like they know you  because they've heard you for so many years.  And they've heard you bringing to the playa what you bring to the playa,  which is you and the people you've gathered.  And it's amazing.  And this is me.",

Here are some pro tips for making the best of this  of your Exodus.  The best times to leave are early in the morning and late at night.  The longest waits are the few hours after the manburne  and the temple burn.  The gate team calculates wait times  from the former Greeder station  to the entrance to County Road 34.  If you're just departing your camp  or encounter a backup before getting to Greeders  or there's an accident down the road,  please know, your wait could be longer.  Gate Road pulsing will also extend wait time.  Pulsing allows the gate team to get the maximum amount of cars  on the County Road 34 without causing backups  in Girlock and Empire.  If you're on Gate Road during pulsing,  turn off your engine and get comfortable.  Get out of your car, walk around,  meet your temporary neighbors, drink water,  take a nap, use the potty,  you get the idea.  Lastly, have an Exodus plan.  Use a well-rested, designated driver  for the first leg of Exodus  and to get you all the way home.  Getting out of Black Oxyde can be exhausting  and difficult after all your play experiences.  We all want you to make it home in one piece  and come back next year.  Please drive safe.  Please don't die.",

In these hot, playa conditions, the ice in your coolers will melt and your food can quickly  come out of temperature and become unsafe to eat.  To prevent foodborne illness, it is important to keep cold foods cold, at or below 41 degrees  Fahrenheit, and to keep hot foods hot above 135 degrees Fahrenheit.  If you don't maintain these temperatures, the number of bacteria in the food will quickly  multiply, doubling every 20 minutes.  So please keep foods out of the temperature danger zone.  Check your coolers and replenish ice often.  If you are using ice as a coolant, be sure it surrounds your food containers and is not  just below the food.  And remember to be prepared and stock up on backup ice before you need it.  If it rains, or there are other emergencies on the playa, arcticas hours may change.

I want to say that I am a hippie rogue as you said.  I have been rediscovering my story and my snaps of fire  being back with these colleagues.  And is there a way to make peace love  and harmony with the dragon rather than killing it?  I mean, he said the dragon wasn't a community shelter.  The lamp ladders.  It has not been loved for a very long time.  The adopted dragon probably feels very unloved by his mother  who gave him up when he was young.  The dragon was actually burning down the community shelter.  You could probably use the dragon to light your lamps.  Do you think you can make friends with the dragon?  It seems pretty content on lighting people, not lamps.  All right. Fellow adventurers, I say we go.  Let's say you go to the lamp ladders.  Robot, you must stay, continue to dig until you find the bag of cheeses  with a tiny man inside of it.  I dig it. Dig casual.  Dig casual. We'll be back, robot.  Should we roll for initiative to see who goes first  when we see the dragon?  Absolutely.  I roll 17.  So close, 16.  I got a rock.  And as you follow the halfling to his community shelter  where the dragon is rampaging community shelter,  you see a large dragon.  And whoever rolled highest sees it first.  That was me.  Dragon, I say.  Why must you wreak havoc upon this community shelter  of lighters of the lamp?  Is that what the dragon says?  Dragons don't actually speak common, so.  They speak draconian as our halfling friend just reminded us.  Do I speak draconian?  It doesn't say on my sheet.  I will use nonverbal language.  I will strip myself naked and then I sewed the beast  and turn over and I face down on the ply and offer myself  in a sacrifice of love.  I cast lightning bolt upon heel-yoi sartas  because I don't like what he's doing right now.  It's making me very uncomfortable.  And over the air we hear the sexy jams being played at BMI.  The dragon sees you present yourself to him  and he is distracted temporarily.  As he flies over, you can see his dragon erection growing and growing.  I cast a feeble mind upon the dragon.  At the very moment of penetration.  I cast a feeble mind on the dragon.  What was it before that?  What was lightning bolt upon heel-yoi?  At the moment that happens, the dragon makes penetration.  It was too late.  It is instantaneous dragon orgasm.  Is that what my lightning bolt did?  What is that?  Too late.  It is instantaneous dragon orgasm.  Is that what my lightning bolt did?  What is that?",

In 2017, I was nearly involved in a head-on collision with the participant who crossed  the EWL line in Nevada State Highway 447 to pass slower vehicles due to an excess.  Every year during this event, I deal with crashes for assault and for persistent speeding, driving  unsafely, or losing control of an over-load of vehicles.  I understand you want to get to the event, and when it's over, get home.  It's not worth putting your life or others at risk, just to save a few minutes.  There are a few tips to ensure you drive to and from the event is uneven.  First, observe the speed limits.  This should be a given.  It is even more important if you're driving a heavy loaded vehicle or one you're unfamiliar  with like a rental.  Two, don't pass long-line vehicles.  This can be deceiving.  If you miss charging camera on common traffic, you go on to force other drivers to take the  base direction so you can get back in line.  There, if you're tirelessly the pullover rest, it only takes us a moment of inattention to  drive off the road and just control of a vehicle.  Sport.  If you see an emergency vehicle with light flashing, slow down, and pull over regardless of  what direction you're headed, fit.  If you're driving at the dark, watch for life's back on the road, swarming to avoid a cow  off any results, and drivers lose control of their vehicles.  In six, please worry you keep close at all times, you never know when you're going to need  it.  And we say also, put that within the right hour of the call, thank you.",

    "transcript": "Here's some important information you need to know about new guidelines for the burns.  The burn perimeters may be held longer than in previous years in order to let the heat  get down to a manageable level.  Please do not enter a burn circle.  You will be asked to move back into the crowd.  Remember, you are responsible for your own actions and to support those around you.  Get to know those around you.  Introduce yourself.  And if someone seems to be having a really, really bad day, call for help immediately.  The perimeter volunteer in front of you is connected to all the civic services of BlackRock  City, including medical and the Rangers.  They have people on call 24-7 who can provide judgment-free help through a difficult,  physical, emotional, or psychological experience.  All you need to do is ask them for help.  This goes double for anyone you see in distress after the burn ends and everyone starts leaving.  If someone next to you starts talking about rushing the fire, you can engage them calmly  and clearly.  You can tell them that every time we burn art, we are proving to the world that we can do  this safely.  And every time someone behaves unsafely at a burn, it puts the future of burning man in jeopardy.  If they listen, great, you've done the city of service.  But if they make moves towards the perimeter, point them out to a perimeter volunteer right  away.  And if they wander off, tell a perimeter person about the conversation, including details on  the person's appearance.  Do not try to physically restrain that person and definitely do not put yourself in harm's  way.  Point them out and let the perimeter team take it from there.  And finally, please keep tabs on your children.  Every year we get reports of families getting separated at the big burns.  Let's help each other stay safe out there.",

    "transcript": "And I went in, I got this drink, and I walked out to figure out what to do, and when I walked  outside, this guy I knew wasn't a scuffle.  He was in a scuffle with this really angry ranger.  And I was trying to figure out what to do and what was going on, and kind of like just watching,  kind of being a looky-loo, and my acquaintance was trying to escape.  He was like, look man, let go of me, let go of me, leave me alone.  And I learned much, much later that there was this ranger had been sort of power tripping  around, like the intersection, and making a big scene.  And this guy I knew had gone up and punctuated the kind of confrontation with a handful  of dust, a handful of thrown dust, which of course didn't solve anything, just escalated  in situations.  So they were in this scuffle.  This guy I know was like, come on man, leave me alone, please, please let this go.  And the ranger, in the meantime, is hanging on to this guy I know.  He's got to buy the lapels, and he's got to buy the lapels with one hand.  And with the other hand, he's calling into his radio.  He's calling, he's saying, hey, I need every police officer I can, I need backup,  I need backup.  There's a guy here, he's here at three in B, and he's attacking people, he's attacking random  people.  And I'm like, oh man, what's going on here?  So in this whole scuffle, this guy I know, he escapes.  He escapes, and he takes off into some alley, and he's gone.  And almost on cue, every cop on playa rolls into three in B, and it's cop cars.  It's locals.  It's feds.  Like, you know, it's ever, it's rangers, it's like police lights, it's like excuse me,  you didn't need to move back sir right now.  It's like, you know, the zillion uniforms, and all of these burners in this intersection  looking super confused and upset, and like, you know, like, come on, I came out to the desert  to like get away from this.  Like, what's going on?  What's going on?  And, you know, and I'm kind of walking out of the intersection, and I'm kind of figuring  out what to do in the state of bewilderment.  And I hear somebody calling my name, you know, hey, hey, hey, and somebody's calling  my name, and I turn around and I look up to where this sound is coming from, and my  two dear friends are up on top of this art car.  And they're yelling at me to get my attention to say hi, but they're dressed as unicorns.  And they're up on top of this double-decker unicorn art car with like 40 other people dressed  like unicorns, and I realize it's the beginning of the unicorn stampede.  And the whole point of the unicorn stampede was to get everybody up dressed as unicorns,  cover themselves in glitter, and just get, and just stampede through the city, invading  every camp, every party, every street, just getting all up in everybody's business.  Like with super obnoxious, perky, perky, perky vibes, and just covering everybody head to  toe in glitter like dry-humping them.  So 40 unicorns all become pouring off this art car.  They come pouring into the intersection, and they're all up on everybody.  You know, my friends are up on me, like they're dry-humping me and saying nice things about  me.  They're up on all the people that pass us by in the intersection.  They're up on all the cops, all the rangers, like everybody in this intersection is suddenly  getting dry-humped by a unicorn-covered in glitter.  And everyone is simultaneously prevented from taking anything seriously at the same time.  And all the cops, you know, realize there's nothing to it and they leave, and all the  passengers by are, you know, they're bad vibes, you're neutralized, and they go off  into the city, and that's the story about the day, the unicorn, and safe burning men.  Okay, was this a real story or a joke?  This is a true, true story, honest to the ghost of Larry Harvey.  And what year was this again?  This was either 2009 or 2010, I would guess.  That is excellent.  Thank you so much, Richard, for sharing your story.  Thanks for having me on.  I love it.",

Or near an ignition source.  Keep a fire extinguisher easily accessible and visible  within 10 feet of your fuel storage.  We recommend a 40B rating 5 pound extinguisher.  Three, no more than 255 gallon fuel drums,  or no more than 110 gallons of fuel total,  can be stored in a camp.  Four, keep your fuel storage area at least 10 feet from heat sources,  such as burn barrels, grills, stoves, running gennies,  RVs, tents, trailers, camp structures, and public areas.  Never store fuel inside or under a living area.  Five, if your neighboring campus storing fuel,  keep your stores at least 100 feet apart.  Six, all containers, no matter the size,  have to be stored in secondary containment basins,  in case the fuel container fails.  The containment has to be capable of holding 110%  the volume of the largest container stored within it.",

Now, it kind of just looked like a freckle or something, just sort of in my eye. It kind of felt like when maybe sunscreen goes into your eye and it kind of just stings.  It was kind of a minor annoyance, but I tried to wash it out a few times and didn't really see me working, so I was like, okay, I should probably get checked out.  So I went down to rampart, and we talked to one of the paramedics, and I think you went through probably an entire bottle of saline and tried to flesh out my eye. It just didn't see me working.  So, finally, it goes, okay, let me go talk to someone, and he goes inside, and this surgeon comes out, and takes one look at me, and he goes, yeah, that's metal, that's not coming out.  So it goes, okay, I come inside, we need to get this out like ASAP. So we go inside, and this doctor was pretty cool, he had a mohawk, we're sitting around talking about metal, we were making jokes about like, oh, you're having the most metal day ever out here.  And I remember I turned to him, and I was like, yeah, the only thing missing is Slayer's Raining Blood, and yet a Bluetooth speaker, and if he goes over and turns on a Raining Blood, it was fantastic.  And then he turns to me, and he goes, okay, joking aside, we're surgically removing this. And I'm like, okay, and he goes, okay, pick a point at the ceiling and just stare at it, and he comes in with the needle, and starts just picking this thing out of my eye.  And he kind of explained to me that your eyes don't have a whole lot of nerve endings, so it wasn't too painful, just incredibly uncomfortable.  But he just sort of said, pick a corner at the ceiling and just stare, and from there he got it out, but then there was rust in my eyes.  They had to take the same needle and carve out two layers of my cornea, and then to top it off after they got that out, they gave me a tetanus shot in my eyeball.  And this all sounds pretty intense, but I would say this all took place over the course of maybe 20 minutes, and I came back to camp, and basically I was like, man, you guys are not going to believe what just happened to me.",

    "transcript": "And I think of 1996 is like a turning point year,  because that was the year last year of John Law,  one of the founders of Burning Man,  last year of guns and a lot less rules.  The last year of no city streets really.  And that was before there was a real map of the city.  So that was a turning point year.  The next turning point year, 2007, which  is the year of the, well, let me just tell the story.  So 2007, let me set it up.  For years and years and years, speaking of pranks,  there was this movement in Black Rock City,  burn the man on Wednesday, burn the man early.  Because especially old-timers who've been coming out  here for a while kind of felt like things are predictable.  It's like, yeah, we burned the man on Saturday.  There's a big fireworks display.  It's like Disneyland, right?  And so it was like, burn the man early.  And it was a joke until it wasn't, you know?  And so there we are on Sunday night.  Larry Harvey had just stopped by our camp  because that was the last year of his clear  and he wanted to come hang out.  And we're like, hanging out, fabulous night.  It was a warm, beautiful night.  It was a lunar eclipse.  We wanted to go out to the playa, see the lunar eclipse.  I'm running around with my friend Yaya.  And we're walking in towards the open playa.  And we see this flame in the distance.  And we're like, oh, wow, they're burning something early.  Oh, that's kind of cool for the,  I mean, it's before gates were really open, right?  You know, gates are just opened  or they're about to open and we look.  And I'm like, it feels like the man's burning.  That night I can't be it.  And then we see a golf cart zipping by a top speed.  And we're like, oh, my God, wait, what's going on?  And they recognize me.  And I'm like, get Adrian, get in.  And I'm like, we get in.  I was like, it looks like the man's burning.  And I'm like, it's because the man is burning.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  So the rangers who picked us up in the golf cart  are freaking out, freaking out.  Meanwhile, me and Yaya are like, oh my God,  it's finally happening.  It's finally happening.  They're finally burning the man early.  It's this is the thing.  So we're like zipping out to the burn.  And I have to, it was the best burn I'd ever.  I mean, maybe the second pass.  I mean, really, I kind of think like burning man is sort of like,  you know, your first one, there's nothing you can compare it to  because you got nothing to do.  You have very little reference points.  So just seeing the epicness of it is pretty special,  especially when it was only 800 people in the middle of the desert  like it was in, you know, the early 90s.  But this was, oh my God, best burn ever.  There was a spot in 80 to it.  There was unexpectedness to it.  It was what burning man was supposed to be.  It was like, oh my God, you never know what's going to happen.  It's not scheduled.  It's not planned.  And it's like, oh my God, it is the burning man.  And it's burning just a few days early, you know.  So we loved it.  And then I was like, it was like a crowd, of course,  or surrounded it.  And so you've got half the crowd, you know, chanting,  let it burn, let it burn.  And then you've got the, you know, other half the crowd  like chanting something like, you know, like, you know,  put it out, put it out.  I mean, it was like, it was, it was very spontaneous  and it was interactive.  And it was, it was just, you know, I hate  to use the term, it was a magical night at Burning Man  because it gets overused.  But that was a magical night at Burning Man.  It really, it kind of captured something.  I wrote about it in, in my book, where I really  like how to say, where is it?  I had a couple of juicy quotes I wanted to quote.  But I'm probably like, you know, oh,  you know, whether or yelling was save the man,  that's what it was.  You know, we were yelling, let it burn.  And then there was another half that, you know,  we're like, save the man and, you know,  and then we overheard like some people saying,  it's like, oh my god, well, you know, like newbies.  Well, what are we gonna do on Saturday night now?  You know, and it's like, as if like Black Rock City  has not got a zillion other things going on.  I mean, they kind of like, hadn't figured out yet,  that Burning Man is so much more, like,  like the burning of the man is practically  an afterthought at this point.  It's, you know, it's so much what happens the week of, right?  And it was really exciting.  And, you know, within hours, you know,  we were drunkenly making shirts that said,  you know, what we were calling it.  I mean, this is probably not probably,  this is extremely important.  But we were like, oh, this is Burning Man's 9-11.  And, you know, it was happened on August 28th.  So we made shirts like 8-28 was an inside job.  Never forget.  And, you know, it all turned into like a bit of a,  like a, you know, a meme, really a community meme.  And then it came out that Paul Addis was the arsonist.  So then there's like, you know, free Paul Addis,  like the stickers going around.  And, you know, it immediately turned into a joke.  And I wish that the Burning Man organization  would have kind of like embraced it and been like,  okay, well, we're just gonna like leave it here  and maybe we'll finish it off on Saturday night.  But, you know, I mean, on the one hand,  I feel like that's what they should have done.  But I also know it was a nice rallying thing,  a challenge for the man crew that you're at,  a couple of friends on man crew  that were like, they really enjoyed stepping up  and it was like, wow, what normally takes a month.  We threw together in three days, yay, us.  So that was really cool.  What was not cool, I feel is what the Burning Man organization  ended up doing to Paul Addis, where they, you know,  really added up a bunch of stuff.  So instead of it just being a misdemeanor  ended up being a federal felony  and you know, Paul Addis ended up going to prison  for a few years and, you know, I kind of felt a little bit  of like, you know, I felt sorry for him,  you know, until I met him and realized  what a utter crazy nut job he is.  But unfortunately, what Paul Addis needed  was mental health, not two years of prison  and you know, a few years later,  he ended up throwing himself into a train  and killing himself.  But before that, you know, he pulled off  probably the ultimate, the ultimate Burning Man prank,  which was burning the man on, not on Burning Man's terms,  but on his own terms.  So.",

That game has some great music, it's one of the most popular soundtracks ever, with good  reason.  There's some interesting thing about Chiptune era music here is that there's all these  kind of interesting sound ship programming techniques that go into making the music more  exciting because you have this really kind of simple digital synthesizer, and if you wanted  to do cool sounding things, like we all enjoy in this era of post-recorded music where,  yeah, you can do anything with sound.  If they wanted to do something like in that song, you heard like kind of echoing sounds,  you hear the melody and it would be echoed, and they actually would like program the synthesizer  just to repeat every single note, but quieter or something like that to make echoes.  Anywho, it's all fascinating to me to hear the art created within limitations, especially  when you know the limitations.",

I'm sorry, not on the Playa, made of car hoods.  And it was meant to talk about climate change and talk about the polar bears placed in the world  and how their place in the world is kind of displacing the polar bears with climate change.

I wasn't thinking about it but as I was walking by I really liked that people weren't staring  at me and I felt very safe even though I was fully naked and I thought it's great  nobody even notices.  And then a guy in a camp said hey you look like you could use some more sun protection  and he handed me a parasol and I thought that is the kind of way that I want my nakedness  to be noticed.  He noticed and it was in a way that was caring and I really appreciated it.  Come by BMIR between noon and four to record an entry in our diary.",

Last, but not least, be sure to wash your hands properly back at your camp often, because  hand sanitizers are not effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy, as they often  are after camping for a few days, if you call this camping.  To properly wash your hands, wet them with warm, potable running water, then lather liquid  soap in your hands and scrub them for at least 20 seconds.  Then rinse your hands well under clean running water and dry your hands using paper towels.  Turn off the faucet with the paper towel.  Again, wash hands before you handle food.
