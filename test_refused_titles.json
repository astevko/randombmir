So, destruction of art is not participation,  and it's not radical self-expression. It's vandalism, and it's not tolerated in Black Rock City,  plain and simple. This week, the beloved art installation, Paraluna, was carelessly destroyed.  Also, one of the ice sheep was stolen. These are works that took the artist months to conceptualize  plan, transport, and construct all for the enjoyment of Burning Man participants. Breaking someone's  art isn't funny, and stealing art is not a prank. There's nothing playful or clever about  destroying an artist's work and property, and it discourages them from continuing to contribute  to our city again. If you see something, say something to the people doing it or inform a Black Rock  Ranger, and if you can't or want respect the art, then don't come to Black Rock City.",

Big camps, big events, big ideas, big vehicles, big art,  and a big population in one of the biggest open spaces in the world.  It's easy to get swept up by the bigness of it all.  But consider this, bigger isn't always better.  Amidst all the spectacular bigness,  there are thousands of smaller wonders and human-sized miracles all over the playa.  Things you'll miss out on if you're only gazing up at the gargantuan.  Smaller projects can provide a unique and intimate experience you can't get with the mammoth works.  And many take just as much creativity and effort as the larger scale ones.  Burning Man is about what you contribute.  The interactivity you bring, the art you create.  You don't need a six-figure budget and a big crew.  Think about it.  Many of today's biggest theme camps and best known artists started small.  The seeds of future year's spectacles are germinating right now.  All over the playa and in the back streets of Black Rock City.  Right under your nose and under the radar.  So ask yourself, when you explore a city,  do you only stick to the main thoroughfares and the big attractions?  Or do you search out the road less traveled?  When you look back at your photos from Burning Man, how many feature the big art?  This year, challenge yourself to find the unexpected, the smaller,  the lower-budget expressions of art.  Give a big thank you to the artists.  Invite an artist to create a small installation for the frontage of your camp.  And if you're looking to engage your kids at Burning Man,  ask them defined examples of small, inspiring art on the playa.  Burning Man is a city full of wonders, big and small.

Here are the basics.  One, fuel expands with heat.  Never fill your fuel containers past 80%.  Store your fuel in the shade if you can,  but never in a confined space under or near a structure.  Or near an ignition source.  Keep a fire extinguisher easily accessible and visible  within 10 feet of your fuel storage.  We recommend a 40B rating 5 pound extinguisher.  Three, no more than 255 gallon fuel drums,  or no more than 110 gallons of fuel total,  can be stored in a camp.  Four, keep your fuel storage area at least 10 feet from heat sources,  such as burn barrels, grills, stoves, running gennies,  RVs, tents, trailers, camp structures, and public areas.  Never store fuel inside or under a living area.  Five, if your neighboring campus storing fuel,  keep your stores at least 100 feet apart.  Six, all containers, no matter the size,  have to be stored in secondary containment basins,  in case the fuel container fails.  The containment has to be capable of holding 110%  the volume of the largest container stored within it.",

And is there a way to make peace love  and harmony with the dragon rather than killing it?  I mean, he said the dragon wasn't a community shelter.  The lamp ladders.  It has not been loved for a very long time.  The adopted dragon probably feels very unloved by his mother  who gave him up when he was young.  The dragon was actually burning down the community shelter.  You could probably use the dragon to light your lamps.  Do you think you can make friends with the dragon?  It seems pretty content on lighting people, not lamps.  All right. Fellow adventurers, I say we go.  Let's say you go to the lamp ladders.  Robot, you must stay, continue to dig until you find the bag of cheeses  with a tiny man inside of it.  I dig it. Dig casual.  Dig casual. We'll be back, robot.

And as you follow the halfling to his community shelter  where the dragon is rampaging community shelter,  you see a large dragon.  And whoever rolled highest sees it first.  That was me.  Dragon, I say.  Why must you wreak havoc upon this community shelter  of lighters of the lamp?  Is that what the dragon says?  Dragons don't actually speak common, so.  They speak draconian as our halfling friend just reminded us.  Do I speak draconian?  It doesn't say on my sheet.  I will use nonverbal language.  I will strip myself naked and then I sewed the beast  and turn over and I face down on the ply and offer myself  in a sacrifice of love.  I cast lightning bolt upon heel-yoi sartas  because I don't like what he's doing right now.  It's making me very uncomfortable.  And over the air we hear the sexy jams being played at BMI.  The dragon sees you present yourself to him  and he is distracted temporarily.  As he flies over, you can see his dragon erection growing and growing.  I cast a feeble mind upon the dragon.  At the very moment of penetration.  I cast a feeble mind on the dragon.  What was it before that?  What was lightning bolt upon heel-yoi?  At the moment that happens, the dragon makes penetration.

    "transcript": "This is, let's take you back to 1997, 5 a.m. on burn morning day night.  Chicken John was and still is the master of ceremonies.  When he stepped into the ring, the world belonged to him.  There he would stand in his cruddy tuxedo and a top hat shoved a bit forward over his black glasses.  The top hat and suit looked run over. It was part of his stick.  Then he would take control of the show and his loud, reedy voice.  The son of like a parrot had an obo stuck in his throat and announced the opening act,  which was usually featured as dog dammit.  For our next act, we're going to bring my best friend a long time for a former dammit, the wonder dog.  Dammit was an Australian blue healer. He was a crazy person.  Chicken would have several props on stage waiting for him such as a hoop to jump through  or a beach ball to balance on his nose, things that looked like something to juggle.  The gypsy clown band would start to play with fat man D, dressed in half man, half woman on a cello  and the rest of them dressed in crazy cruddy carny garb.  They call themselves the organ grinders from hell.  This was his act. That was his stick. This was circus ridiculous.  And now chicken announced between one of his acts.  We're going to bring on a man eating chicken.  I would walk a man eating a piece of chicken.  How about that folks? Let's give him a round of applause.  Insectivora 8 insects, fecal, the brown clown sang a song about poop.  He wore what looked like a shit-covered clown suit and had gloves on with turds for fingers.  There was Danny girl, the puppet show, the Armenian rubberman, and the heavy petal cycle side with this parade of Frankenstein bikes.  The acts kept coming and the whole thing, the whole time the band played, halfway through the show, fat man D just stood up and shouted.  Welcome to Cirque de Soul Lane.  Then came the final act, the vegan geek.  Out came Jericho with Strokey, which was a hen.  If you read the book, the whole part two of the books called The Adventures of Strokey and Chokey.  And Strokey was one of the hens.  So I recognized her feet. Jericho strolled out with her under his arm.  For those who don't know what a geek act is, it's an act where you bite the head off a chicken.  But Jericho had worked it out so it was just a head of lettuce.  It was a benign act.  Wow, ladies and gentlemen, I will bite the head off of this chicken.  Can I get a drum roll please?  By now, a pretty large crowd had gathered.  And there were, there were twitters and snorts of laughter as we all knew that the act was a spoof.  Strokey the chicken was as calm as an old fat cat.  As he collect her head around the circle, a drum roll started.  This was Jericho's show, and he was milking it.  After walking around the circle, holding Strokey up high, he came back to the center circle and put Strokey's head right.  And then he bit down on her neck just enough to make her start struggling around as the crowd got uneasy.  As the drum roll continued, it was Jesse Waxq for his entrance.  Dressed in a full cow suit, plastic gutters and all.  He ran in, grabbed Strokey away and shoved ahead of lettuce.  Iceberg lettuce in Jericho's mouth instead.  Jericho took a huge bite out of the lettuce and spit it all back at us.  I'm the vegan geek. I'm the vegan geek, he cried.  But, but, but.  There's always a but.  But, while everyone was still laughing and applauding in psychedelic delirium, Jesse Waxq went back to the center of the ring and did the unthinkable.  He stuck Strokey's head into his mouth and bit down hard while yanking the poor chicken's body away.  There was a creepy popping sound like someone cracking their knuckle as Jesse spit the head out onto the ground.  An immediate geyser of blood shot him in the face and filled his mouth as blood gushed down his cow suit and shout out, shout everywhere.  He dropped the chicken and a headless Strokey hit the grounder on him.  The horrified crowd recoiled a disbelief.  This was no longer a circus ridiculous.  His all search for the joke.  But, there was no joke.  We really had all just witnessed a brutal murder.  There's another cog of fate kicked in.  The harrowing bird karma that I had been cursed with by stomping those birdies all those months ago.  Came back at me with yet another blow.  The headless nightmare of Strokey came running straight towards me as I sat cross-legged in the front row.  She rushed at me in a chicken sprint with wings flapping while sputtering like a shot down warplane.  Her talons ripped into me as she clamored up my chest.  The blood spurting everywhere.  I will never forget her severed neckbone wagging around as if it were searching for an answer.  I scrambled backwards in a panic as I tried to swat the madness away.  This was no time to be on psychedelics.  Everybody was freaking out.  Everybody!  Nobody could believe that Jesse and Jesse got it.  Everybody was losing their cool.  Yeah.  I managed to kick this nightmare into another direction in the freak zombie of Strokey tore around and around the crowd knocking and bumping into things as everyone scrambled to get out of the way.  It took a full three minutes for her to die.  That's an eternity in stage time.  This also enough time for it to truly sink in that this was no prank that it truly had just happened.  There was a conclusive silence when Strokey finally laid to rest.  Then there was a dark silence.  Everyone and everything was covered in chicken blood, especially my shirt.  The crowd was starting to turn.  They were angry that their jolly laughs had just been jared into a gruesome reality.  They were angry that a goofball in a cow suit had committed this crime.  They were angry at being duped by circus carnies.  But no one was as angry as chicken John.  No one dared fuck with his show and Jesse whack was in deep shit.  To this day, I still have no idea what magic words chicken John used that morning to save his show.  As he took centering and calm the crowd back to his bidding.  We were in the presence of showmaster genius.  He spoke words and the crowd relaxed.  It was like the Jedi trick.  I don't know what the hell he said.  I don't believe that for a minute.  I won't come on man.  Chicken never said any comment anybody down the go ahead.  The way you write it.  Everyone slowly dispersed into the morning.  The spell was broken.  Why did the fuck did you do that Jesse?  Chicken's John's face is about two clicks away from Jesse's snows.  I don't know Jesse answered.  It was our last show and I never geeked a chicken before.  I wanted to see what it was like.  It was a geek act after all, wasn't it?  Besides we're all hungry and we can just eat the thing tomorrow.  That's right. That's right.  Chico cooked it.  He went up over and picked up the dead chicken.  It was still dripping.  Nobody fucks with my show.  This is circus ridiculous.  Things are never supposed to get serious you shithead.  You're out of the act.  Chicken John turned and stomped off.  There was an awkward silence since the morning was almost in full light.  Yeah, we'll just eat stroki tomorrow.  That'll make it right.  We all turn to the familiar voice of Jericho who's standing there facing Jesse.  Gone was his snaggle tooth grin.  What he did next was the deepest of noble punishment.  He simply walked over to Jesse, took the dead headless bird from his hands, and cradled her away.  Jesse was left alone to see only the backs of his friends.  I stood there thinking of poor stroki.  Thinking of how hard it must be to be a wild hand out here in the high desert Nevada.  And as the chicken were able to have such thoughts as luck and fate,  which he have ever in a wildest dreams conceived their life would end by a crazy cook in a cow suit,  biting her head off during a traveling circus show called Circus Ridiculous,  in a strange cowl town called Black Rock City during an event called Burning Man at Dawn.  I love Jesse wax.  I love everything he ever did.  He's so chicken what it was really like to be frickin real.  I love hearing a storyteller read their own book.  Doctor Hell.",

    "transcript": "And I went in, I got this drink, and I walked out to figure out what to do, and when I walked  outside, this guy I knew wasn't a scuffle.  He was in a scuffle with this really angry ranger.  And I was trying to figure out what to do and what was going on, and kind of like just watching,  kind of being a looky-loo, and my acquaintance was trying to escape.  He was like, look man, let go of me, let go of me, leave me alone.  And I learned much, much later that there was this ranger had been sort of power tripping  around, like the intersection, and making a big scene.  And this guy I knew had gone up and punctuated the kind of confrontation with a handful  of dust, a handful of thrown dust, which of course didn't solve anything, just escalated  in situations.  So they were in this scuffle.  This guy I know was like, come on man, leave me alone, please, please let this go.  And the ranger, in the meantime, is hanging on to this guy I know.  He's got to buy the lapels, and he's got to buy the lapels with one hand.  And with the other hand, he's calling into his radio.  He's calling, he's saying, hey, I need every police officer I can, I need backup,  I need backup.  There's a guy here, he's here at three in B, and he's attacking people, he's attacking random  people.  And I'm like, oh man, what's going on here?  So in this whole scuffle, this guy I know, he escapes.  He escapes, and he takes off into some alley, and he's gone.  And almost on cue, every cop on playa rolls into three in B, and it's cop cars.  It's locals.  It's feds.  Like, you know, it's ever, it's rangers, it's like police lights, it's like excuse me,  you didn't need to move back sir right now.  It's like, you know, the zillion uniforms, and all of these burners in this intersection  looking super confused and upset, and like, you know, like, come on, I came out to the desert  to like get away from this.  Like, what's going on?  What's going on?  And, you know, and I'm kind of walking out of the intersection, and I'm kind of figuring  out what to do in the state of bewilderment.  And I hear somebody calling my name, you know, hey, hey, hey, and somebody's calling  my name, and I turn around and I look up to where this sound is coming from, and my  two dear friends are up on top of this art car.  And they're yelling at me to get my attention to say hi, but they're dressed as unicorns.  And they're up on top of this double-decker unicorn art car with like 40 other people dressed  like unicorns, and I realize it's the beginning of the unicorn stampede.  And the whole point of the unicorn stampede was to get everybody up dressed as unicorns,  cover themselves in glitter, and just get, and just stampede through the city, invading  every camp, every party, every street, just getting all up in everybody's business.  Like with super obnoxious, perky, perky, perky vibes, and just covering everybody head to  toe in glitter like dry-humping them.  So 40 unicorns all become pouring off this art car.  They come pouring into the intersection, and they're all up on everybody.  You know, my friends are up on me, like they're dry-humping me and saying nice things about  me.  They're up on all the people that pass us by in the intersection.  They're up on all the cops, all the rangers, like everybody in this intersection is suddenly  getting dry-humped by a unicorn-covered in glitter.  And everyone is simultaneously prevented from taking anything seriously at the same time.  And all the cops, you know, realize there's nothing to it and they leave, and all the  passengers by are, you know, they're bad vibes, you're neutralized, and they go off  into the city, and that's the story about the day, the unicorn, and safe burning men.  Okay, was this a real story or a joke?  This is a true, true story, honest to the ghost of Larry Harvey.  And what year was this again?  This was either 2009 or 2010, I would guess.  That is excellent.  Thank you so much, Richard, for sharing your story.  Thanks for having me on.  I love it.",

    "transcript": "So, the first one is 1996, which is a bit of a turning point here for Burning Man, because  that was the year...well, that was the first year that anyone actually died out here,  technically right before the event started, so not technically at Burning Man, but let's  face it.  They were out here because it was Burning Man, and people got hurt that year, and let's  do the math.  At that point, it was around 10,000 people, you get that many people together, you're bound  to have a few jerks.  People were getting used to the fact that it was like the world's most dangerous arts  festival, and people could drive, and people could have guns, and so thankfully nobody got  shot, but people did all the one death, and then the three really critical injuries were  all...well, vehicle-related, so that was the last year with cars.  That was also the last year with one of the three founders of Burning Man.  Larry Harvey was really the one who started it, had the idea, but he would not have been  able to do it without Michael Michael, a.k. danger-anger, and also a man named John Law.  And John Law, one of his many tasks regarding the Burning Man project, as it was called  back then, was installing the neon of the man.  Well in 1996, he added some extra neon to the head of the Burning Man.  He installed a smiley face inside the man, and Larry Harvey did not like that idea, and  so of course a lot of drama ensued.  I get a lot of this information second and third-hand, because I'm the unofficial newspaper,  I don't have the inside story on everything, but he kind of pieced things together as a  journalist, and as near as I can tell, John Law did it, Larry didn't like it, so they were  like, okay, you can't turn it on, they weren't going to tear apart the Burning Man's head just  to de-install the smiley face neon.  And apparently it only turned on once for ten seconds, and I thank my lucky stars, I happen  to be right there when it happened, and my partner at the time had a camera, Heather Shurkey,  and she shot what, as far as we know, is the only existing photo of the bright neon yellow  smiley face inside the Burning Man's head that they were not allowed to turn on, but of  course it happened because it's Burning Man, there's no way they're going to install a neon  smiley face without actually turning it on at least once.  So we were lucky, we walked by just as someone was like, hey, hey, hey, we're like, okay,  what's up?  You're like, watch the man's head, I'm like, okay, okay, what's going on, and then it turned  on, I'm like, oh my god, click, click, click, click, and I was like, thanks, you know, and didn't  get anything of it, and it wasn't until years later where we realized, oh, this is kind  of significant because this was a turning point year where that was the last year John Law was  involved with Burning Man, so that was a pretty damn good prank, I like that prank.",

In these hot, playa conditions, the ice in your coolers will melt and your food can quickly  come out of temperature and become unsafe to eat.  To prevent foodborne illness, it is important to keep cold foods cold, at or below 41 degrees  Fahrenheit, and to keep hot foods hot above 135 degrees Fahrenheit.  If you don't maintain these temperatures, the number of bacteria in the food will quickly  multiply, doubling every 20 minutes.  So please keep foods out of the temperature danger zone.  Check your coolers and replenish ice often.  If you are using ice as a coolant, be sure it surrounds your food containers and is not  just below the food.  And remember to be prepared and stock up on backup ice before you need it.  If it rains, or there are other emergencies on the playa, arcticas hours may change.  You will need to demonstrate your burner prowess, enacting the principle of self-reliance  by being prepared and keeping cold foods cold and ice stock, regardless of the outside conditions.

It's a longstanding tradition to sit on the lawn of the school with hundreds of people  and watch the birds gather and dive until the last swift disappears.  As the artist watched this, she was inspired and the next morning,  the vision of that vortex kept popping back into her head.  How could she recreate the movement?  Could it make people feel the same way she did when seeing no swifts?  The vision morphed into a more celestial realm.  She saw stars and planets replacing the dots of birds in the vortex.  Stardust has a spaceship-looking base surrounded by flying saucer benches.  The benches pulse with LED lights.  A metallic modelist extends upwards that houses the cosmic rays that create the light show.

One of the biggest challenges for the Restoration Crew last year was a degradation of the Plyas surface due to speeding on Gate Road,  which led to deep ruts in the road.  Long story short, don't speed on Gate Road or anywhere else in our fine city.  The speed limit on Gate Road is 10 miles per hour and you can't be pulled over by law enforcement if you go faster.  Want more reasons not to speed on Gate Road?  Fine, speeding causes your tires to churn up more of the Plya surface into dust.  More vehicle speeding equals more dust equals worse condition of the Plya on Gate Road.  The dust created from vehicles driving too fast significantly reduces visibility.  This is dangerous for our gate staff who are working on Gate Road in traffic.  It is also dangerous for other drivers when they cannot see clearly.  Lastly, it tears up your suspension.

Here are some pro tips for making the best of this  of your Exodus.  The best times to leave are early in the morning and late at night.  The longest waits are the few hours after the manburne  and the temple burn.  The gate team calculates wait times  from the former Greeder station  to the entrance to County Road 34.  If you're just departing your camp  or encounter a backup before getting to Greeders  or there's an accident down the road,  please know, your wait could be longer.  Gate Road pulsing will also extend wait time.  Pulsing allows the gate team to get the maximum amount of cars  on the County Road 34 without causing backups  in Girlock and Empire.  If you're on Gate Road during pulsing,  turn off your engine and get comfortable.  Get out of your car, walk around,  meet your temporary neighbors, drink water,  take a nap, use the potty,  you get the idea.  Lastly, have an Exodus plan.  Use a well-rested, designated driver  for the first leg of Exodus  and to get you all the way home.  Getting out of Black Oxyde can be exhausting  and difficult after all your play experiences.

There are a few tips to ensure you drive to and from the event is uneven.  First, observe the speed limits.  This should be a given.  It is even more important if you're driving a heavy loaded vehicle or one you're unfamiliar  with like a rental.  Two, don't pass long-line vehicles.  This can be deceiving.

There, if you're tirelessly the pullover rest, it only takes us a moment of inattention to  drive off the road and just control of a vehicle.  Sport.  If you see an emergency vehicle with light flashing, slow down, and pull over regardless of  what direction you're headed, fit.

So if you're listening right now and you  are a female identified individual who likes other female identified individuals, you should head  that way. All are welcome. All are beautiful. I had a fantastic time. I met a woman from Australia  who... It's the accent that sells you. The accent is great. It's not my first time with an  Australian, but what I will say is it is my first time with a woman who made cat ears and a cat tail  out of her own cat's hair. Oh, that's that's really creative, right? It's the positive way  that I'm going to phrase that. And I'll just say this. This wonderful Australian, she told me that  her ears and her tail were made out of her own cat's hair. Cat's name is Bella. She said,  this is Bella and stroked her own cat ears. And then she showed us a picture of Bella,  the white Persian just screaming in the picture. And I said, do you want a fuck?  And I can't... I'm not supposed to really maybe say them in the radio, but that's what I said.  I won't say it again. Well, that's good. We're off to then a wonderful, wonderful start. Wonderful.  Wonderful start. Any other events that you want to really plug right here at the beginning? We'll  continue to do this throughout the show, but things that sound just amazing to attend.  Things that sound amazing to attend. You know, I am so in the moment that I don't even know what else is  happening.",

    "transcript": "And I think of 1996 is like a turning point year,  because that was the year last year of John Law,  one of the founders of Burning Man,  last year of guns and a lot less rules.  The last year of no city streets really.  And that was before there was a real map of the city.  So that was a turning point year.  The next turning point year, 2007, which  is the year of the, well, let me just tell the story.  So 2007, let me set it up.  For years and years and years, speaking of pranks,  there was this movement in Black Rock City,  burn the man on Wednesday, burn the man early.  Because especially old-timers who've been coming out  here for a while kind of felt like things are predictable.  It's like, yeah, we burned the man on Saturday.  There's a big fireworks display.  It's like Disneyland, right?  And so it was like, burn the man early.  And it was a joke until it wasn't, you know?  And so there we are on Sunday night.  Larry Harvey had just stopped by our camp  because that was the last year of his clear  and he wanted to come hang out.  And we're like, hanging out, fabulous night.  It was a warm, beautiful night.  It was a lunar eclipse.  We wanted to go out to the playa, see the lunar eclipse.  I'm running around with my friend Yaya.  And we're walking in towards the open playa.  And we see this flame in the distance.  And we're like, oh, wow, they're burning something early.  Oh, that's kind of cool for the,  I mean, it's before gates were really open, right?  You know, gates are just opened  or they're about to open and we look.  And I'm like, it feels like the man's burning.  That night I can't be it.  And then we see a golf cart zipping by a top speed.  And we're like, oh, my God, wait, what's going on?  And they recognize me.  And I'm like, get Adrian, get in.  And I'm like, we get in.  I was like, it looks like the man's burning.  And I'm like, it's because the man is burning.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  So the rangers who picked us up in the golf cart  are freaking out, freaking out.  Meanwhile, me and Yaya are like, oh my God,  it's finally happening.  It's finally happening.  They're finally burning the man early.  It's this is the thing.  So we're like zipping out to the burn.  And I have to, it was the best burn I'd ever.  I mean, maybe the second pass.  I mean, really, I kind of think like burning man is sort of like,  you know, your first one, there's nothing you can compare it to  because you got nothing to do.  You have very little reference points.  So just seeing the epicness of it is pretty special,  especially when it was only 800 people in the middle of the desert  like it was in, you know, the early 90s.  But this was, oh my God, best burn ever.  There was a spot in 80 to it.  There was unexpectedness to it.  It was what burning man was supposed to be.  It was like, oh my God, you never know what's going to happen.  It's not scheduled.  It's not planned.  And it's like, oh my God, it is the burning man.  And it's burning just a few days early, you know.  So we loved it.  And then I was like, it was like a crowd, of course,  or surrounded it.  And so you've got half the crowd, you know, chanting,  let it burn, let it burn.  And then you've got the, you know, other half the crowd  like chanting something like, you know, like, you know,  put it out, put it out.  I mean, it was like, it was, it was very spontaneous  and it was interactive.  And it was, it was just, you know, I hate  to use the term, it was a magical night at Burning Man  because it gets overused.  But that was a magical night at Burning Man.  It really, it kind of captured something.  I wrote about it in, in my book, where I really  like how to say, where is it?  I had a couple of juicy quotes I wanted to quote.  But I'm probably like, you know, oh,  you know, whether or yelling was save the man,  that's what it was.  You know, we were yelling, let it burn.  And then there was another half that, you know,  we're like, save the man and, you know,  and then we overheard like some people saying,  it's like, oh my god, well, you know, like newbies.  Well, what are we gonna do on Saturday night now?  You know, and it's like, as if like Black Rock City  has not got a zillion other things going on.  I mean, they kind of like, hadn't figured out yet,  that Burning Man is so much more, like,  like the burning of the man is practically  an afterthought at this point.  It's, you know, it's so much what happens the week of, right?  And it was really exciting.  And, you know, within hours, you know,  we were drunkenly making shirts that said,  you know, what we were calling it.  I mean, this is probably not probably,  this is extremely important.  But we were like, oh, this is Burning Man's 9-11.  And, you know, it was happened on August 28th.  So we made shirts like 8-28 was an inside job.  Never forget.  And, you know, it all turned into like a bit of a,  like a, you know, a meme, really a community meme.  And then it came out that Paul Addis was the arsonist.  So then there's like, you know, free Paul Addis,  like the stickers going around.  And, you know, it immediately turned into a joke.  And I wish that the Burning Man organization  would have kind of like embraced it and been like,  okay, well, we're just gonna like leave it here  and maybe we'll finish it off on Saturday night.  But, you know, I mean, on the one hand,  I feel like that's what they should have done.  But I also know it was a nice rallying thing,  a challenge for the man crew that you're at,  a couple of friends on man crew  that were like, they really enjoyed stepping up  and it was like, wow, what normally takes a month.  We threw together in three days, yay, us.  So that was really cool.  What was not cool, I feel is what the Burning Man organization  ended up doing to Paul Addis, where they, you know,  really added up a bunch of stuff.  So instead of it just being a misdemeanor  ended up being a federal felony  and you know, Paul Addis ended up going to prison  for a few years and, you know, I kind of felt a little bit  of like, you know, I felt sorry for him,  you know, until I met him and realized  what a utter crazy nut job he is.  But unfortunately, what Paul Addis needed  was mental health, not two years of prison  and you know, a few years later,  he ended up throwing himself into a train  and killing himself.  But before that, you know, he pulled off  probably the ultimate, the ultimate Burning Man prank,  which was burning the man on, not on Burning Man's terms,  but on his own terms.  So.",

And a lot of the things we had to do was talk to him about dying,  because he was really afraid of dying and of the pain and of...  He thought of death.  It wasn't a gateway or a nice rainbow, but he thought it was a big black thing.  He was going to be in.  And every night when the lights go out, and that was for weeks prior to the decision,  we were talking to him for hours about dying and about his fear for dying and about anything that has to do with that.  And then finally, he decided to talk to our family doctor about that.  And we set a date, and that's the most strange thing you...

But we decided, like only I would not could, that we were going to pass those days like any other day,  because when you spend those days thinking that will be your last day, you cannot...  Right, you cannot focus on that.  No, you cannot do that.  You know when you go to bed, you have to think tomorrow I will die, you die at that moment, actually.  Exactly.  So, it may sound really strange, but we just did groceries, and we just cooked,  and we watched stupid Netflix shows.  I think it was a rain, it was like a costume series.  We finished together, and then he looked at me and he said,  OK, this is part, this is like season number three, and they're going to broadcast season number four in January.  I won't see it.  It's like God damn it.  No, what's going to happen?  Yes, exactly that, he said.  So, we chose to think of those days like it was running, we had thousands of days to spend together.  And actually a few months ago, I just figured that we didn't even say goodbye,  because it didn't feel like saying goodbye.  We didn't say the words, goodbye.  We said, I love you, and I'll stay with you.  And he said he wasn't afraid anymore, and that was really a special moment for us.",

    "transcript": "I'm going to tell you the most true thing that I learned in maximum security  prison.  So my last burn was 2005, I thought was the year that I was arrested for a series of  arson with the Earth Liberation Front and the Animal Liberation Front because we  damaged government property with a political purpose, the court decided that it  was terrorism and I went to a maximum security prison for eight years.  It was not fun times, I pretty much lost everything even even who I thought  that I was, what I thought that I was doing in the world, but in that  space of reaching the end of myself, I had an opportunity to find a source of life  and love and strength within, and it changed me.  Coming back to the burn this year, Luke gave me a sticker that said, it is what it  is.  There's something powerful about surrender, it's not a position of weakness, it is a position  of joining the winning team, life wins, love wins.  Coming back to the burn, I've been able to enter into it from this space of appreciating  the beauty of this sacred place.  It's also been hard, there are challenges out here and there have been times when I asked  myself, why am I putting myself through this?  Overflowing portals on Burnney, building for three days in a white out, there have been  some not fun times, but I think that's part of why we come here.  We could go to a lot of parties, great parties anywhere, we could go see art and music, some  environment that's not trying to kill us, we could even experience a temporary autonomous  community without having dust and absolutely everything.  But we come here, part of why this is sacred space is precisely because it is hard because  we're challenged in being here.  We have the opportunity to reach the end of ourselves, to leave behind who we thought  that we were, what we thought we were capable of, and be transformed to surrender to the  playa, surrender and find that source of life and love, enjoy within us and to know that  we're not alone there.  We're going to leave here, shortly some of us, and go out to a default world that is not  always the way that we want it to be.  You might face circumstances in your life that are hard, that are a challenge, and you can  take this lesson of the playa with you when you go, to know that you have that source  of life and strength, and love within you, and continue to be transformed by it.  That is how we will change the world.",

    "transcript": "Alright, people, if you know Bob, because a lot of you do, probably like 98% of the people out here or out there or wherever, you know what Bob has been doing here for so long since 2000. I always get the year wrong Bob, correct me, 2004.  No idea.  It might be three, but three, four, whatever. A lot of freaking times what I'm saying people. And you have heard his voice on air and you've felt a spirit on air. And those of you know him, know that again he's burning man on legs. And what he's done for the radio station.  Well, you know, I do nothing for this.  You know what I'm sorry.  You ever see the movie called Wagged The Dog?  I've seen Wagged The Dog.  He's like, I'm a producer. You put me in a room full of talented people. I can make things happen.  Yes.  I personally have no talent.  Oh, please.  No, my talent is putting people together and making them all move forward.  It's one of your talents.  We have fabulous, fabulous DJs here.  We do.  We're far more coherent.  Nice, baby.  I can't do what they do.  I can't do what next does.  He's our sound engineer.  I can't do what Mark Chang does.  He's our F guy.  But Bob, not putting together a team.  That's my talent.  I put together.  But haven't you done basically all of that in the past?  No.  I've watched you table the station.  Absolutely not.  I've watched you table the station.  I just passed these things together to hope that it fucking works.  These two humble people.  I can't do what they do.  And it's a collaborative effort.  Of course it is.  I'm not saying you do it all.  But I'm saying you could do it all if you had to.  And you would.  You would.  You would because you're driving your passenger journey.  I would, I would patch together my best efforts.  And it would be sweet.  But you're right.  The crew here are the, one of Bob's magic superstitions.  But I really know what I'm doing.  And I want to, I want to do it better.  So I, I get a team.  Mm-hmm.  And you have evolved this team in a brilliant way,  where everything is right better than it would be.  And now the time has come.  But wasn't it much more fun was just three of us?  Wasn't that so cool working 18 hours a day?  I remember that.  Yeah.  There was no BMIR camp.  No.  There's a little tiny radio station.  That's right.  That's right.  No one would go in the air before 90 am or after 2 am.  Except for you.  Well, one day I said, well, it's just freaking go in the air.  Yes.  Right.  It's time's available.  Right.  I remember that well.  But you're, but I want to affirm that people,  like one of Bob's greatest superhero talents is connecting people.  And that's an important skill for any leader  and Bob has done it brilliantly.  And he will be missed.  But he won't be missed because he'll be here.  I don't mean maybe physically here,  but he will be there.  We'll be back in a couple years.  But Bob, thank you for what you've done.  And again, the last thing I'll say,  maybe the last thing is that people who know you know your spirit,  your drive, your passion, your brilliance, and your heart.  And what I love about you on AirBob  is I think even people that don't know you feel like they know you  because they've heard you for so many years.  And they've heard you bringing to the playa what you bring to the playa,  which is you and the people you've gathered.  And it's amazing.  And this is me.",

    "transcript": "I was asked to talk about him and there's so much to say about Larry.  I was asking friends that knew him.  Last year, all yesterday, I was thinking, what would you say about Larry?  And there were so many different things.  He was a person of so many facets.  It was a genius.  It's not always easy to live with a genius.  He was not very practical.  He was a visionary from childhood on.  An amazing, wonderful, wonderful person who created something so extraordinary and so different  from everything else the world does.  Oh, my God.  There are tons of stories I could tell you about him.  But I think that the most important thing is his ideas.  He believed that work and love and play should all be one thing.  And he didn't really create Burning Man.  He discovered Burning Man.  The very first burn on Baker Beach in San Francisco was a solstice gathering and a lot of us used  to go down for the solstice and build fires.  He and his carpenter, Jerry James, decided, oh, let's build a man and send him on fire.  Poor gasoline on him.  And so at sundown, that's exactly what they did.  Well, there were a lot of people on the beach because it was the solstice and there were a  lot of little fires all over.  But when people saw this flaming human figure, they were drawn like a magnet and people came  around and they spontaneously formed a circle around this burning man or woman or person,  human and held hands.  Most of them hadn't met each other before.  And it was at that moment that Larry realized he had tapped into something really deep.  And he also realized that for the first time in his life, he could get people to do some  of these crazy things that he always dreamed of.  It started really small, but every year it kept getting bigger.  And it was word of mouth.  It was very clandestine because obviously it wasn't legal.  And we burned the man each year on Baker Beach until the fire department met us there.  And they said, you're not going to burn that thing.  So Larry always had his eye on the future.  And I believe that from the very beginning, he foresaw that this could become a movement.  And he wanted it to become big.  And friends said, oh no, let's keep it small, it'll be ruined if it gets big.  Let's keep it just for us.  And there were some major rifts.  And he lost some friends over this, but he was determined, no, this can grow because if  you create a culture where people understand what it's about, it can get as big as you want.  Because new people will be inducted into that culture and they'll understand it.  And guess what happened?  Right?  But it was not easy.  And the part that is not visible to us is all the rough spots in the road.  It was so hard.  There were lots of times when it seemed like burning man was going to self-destruct.  And it took the effort of a lot of new people who gathered around Larry who saw his vision  and realized there were things like we needed a five-mile per hour speed limit for art  cars.  We needed roads and you shouldn't be just driving your car anywhere you wanted to in a white  out.  So we had to have a government.  That was a big concept for anarchists.  But there's a government now that enforces things like if your camp leaves a lot of moop, guess  what?  You don't get any tickets next year.  Something like that.  There is a really wonderful core group of people who work on burning man all year long.  And any of you can become a part of it.  Larry's gone now.  Well, he's not really gone.  But in his body, he's gone.  So now burning man has to grow up.  Because dad's not there helping to make the best decisions, guide things.  We have to now make this real ourselves as we've already been doing.  I mean, look at the creativity in this place.  It's phenomenal.  And the playfulness and the smarts.  You know, it's a fabulous gathering of a huge tribe.  And it can keep growing.  The dearest wish of Larry's heart was that burning man would live on after him.  And he was pretty concerned about that because his health has been bad for a long time.  And he knew that, you know, at some point, he was going to leave us.  And he wanted to make sure that this movement was strong.  And I think it is.",

    "transcript": "Bob Zilla here back in the studio with Heidi McCluskey and your daughters.  Yes. Introduce them.  I brought... well I didn't bring. They decided to come check on me.  They came on their own.  My oldest are Cassidy who's a part of Planets.  And Kayla.  And Kayla.  Kayla half moon bow.  And so let's talk a little about...  So I notice you have a wristband on.  Yes.  And I have a wristband too. I've got what's called a credential for staff.  And tell me about how you...  Evolution.  Tell me about how you as a local.  Because you are in fact a local.  How do you get in and out to the event?  How does that all work?  What's...  Okay. So in the beginning...  You want to get closer to the mic.  Okay. In the beginning long time ago,  we would come out here and actually would come get our picture taken.  And we would get laminates.  How many years do we get laminates this?  At least...  For...  Six, seven years.  Six, seven years you got laminates?  Yeah. We would get laminates.  And then we would get...  Actually, we would get additional guest passes too.  Okay.  I can't remember how many years we got those.  And then they took those away from us.  But now we get the wristband for local tribal members.  It's got our name on it and we get a pass.  It's got your actual name on it.  Yes.  And they look at our...  It's written on there.  They look at our tribal enrollment card and verify the name to the pass.  So we can't sell them.  We could give it away.  But now you used to get...  You could actually sell if you didn't want to go.  Yes. And then that stopped.  Yes. How many years do we get that?  More than a couple.  At least three years.  At least three years, okay.  We wouldn't even...  We'd bring Casca...  We'd bring grandma up here too.  And we would all get our...  Our tickets.  And then we would get the guest passes.  And we would bring our Tahoe...  My Tahoe Deadhead family.  All the younger ones, we would let them come in.  And you can go in and out at your will.  Yes.  So let's say you decide to leave tonight.  Go back home to Wadsworth.  You just go out.  And you have to wait in the gate line.  No, just drive right up to the front gate.  And come back in.  But no, no. So in my world, right?  You're in the gate line.  And if you...  How do you...  See, you turn off the pavement.  How do you not get in that big line?  No, we're still in the big line just like you are.  So you do have to wait in the line.  Oh yeah. Okay. So if you decide to come back tomorrow,  and there's a 10 hour wait, you are waiting 10 hours.  Yes. There's no special entrance for you to get in or out or anything like that.  But you can come in as many times as you want.  You don't have to pay, like, there's an exit fee here.  You've got to get a pass to drive out.  No, we just come in or out.  But you've got to wait in the line.  Yes.  Because we have some...  Like, one of my dear friends, Preciy,  he'll come up for the night.  Like, last night he came up and said it was cold.  And I said he has...  He's going to have to change his outfit  because he's not going to work for tomorrow night.  He's just looking all around.  I've got to be just perfect.  But yeah, so we come in and out.  And my daughter usually stays the whole week.  But do you feel that you used to get that we were talking earlier?  It seems like in terms of entrance,  you used to get more than you do now.  So it's sort of been like diminishing returns, yes?  You know what? It was...  For everything that we have to put up with.  And I do say put up with.  Because in a little tiny town of, I don't know,  maybe a thousand...  There's a thousand in Wadsworth?  Okay.  But...  Well, not everybody in Wadsworth is a member of the tribe.  No, no.  Our total tribal enrollment runs about 2600-something.  We have three communities.  Succliffe, which we call Saha.  The tribal seat is Nixon.  And then there's Wadsworth.  And...  Is there just small little communities?  Sure.  For the moment, maybe two, three weeks prior when the early entries start coming in,  it does disrupt.  Right. And one of the big things that we have discussed,  and we'll get on to the law enforcement action a little bit later,  is, you know,  the local communities do not appreciate people speeding through their town.  I mean, this is where you...  No one wants someone going 70 miles an hour down their street,  and that applies here, too.  So, hence, the speed zones,  when you're coming into a town, you'll see, you know,  70, 55...  And it goes down and down and down.  And do people respect that for the most part?  You know what? I would say...  I would say 98%  follow everything.  Right.  The 2% that doesn't really fucks it up.  Because they pass in the school zone.  They will try to pass in places like dead-ox.  We've had members driven off the side of the road.  I've had a cousin who I hit,  and from that time on, she's had troubles.  So, not only is it dangerous,  but people can get it, people can't,  and do get injured.  But it's also disrespectful to the community.  But you know what?  And as much as we can say it over and over and over,  that little 2%,  1% still will never listen.  Because even driving up here today,  I was getting passed by some big RVs.  Right.  And there's no need to rush.  Everybody's getting here the same...  There's just no need to...  Well, there's a lot of formal from participants.  Oh, I get nervous because I'm going to miss the thing  at whatever time.  Yeah.  Which is really not important.  I don't want to be there, but it's not so important  that you need to endanger other people  and especially people who live here.  The thing that for tribal members,  I think the really thing that just greats everybody,  it's just speeding the passing and the garbage.  I was going to ask you next, what about the trash?  What's the impact of the trash?  I think from my perspective, from what I've been told,  a lot of people,  so they've got to trip back a trash,  it's on the back of their load.  I've heard it properly.  It falls off.  Some of them, a lot of them might have made me think they got...  They're close.  They have no idea, but still it's an impact.  So how much garbage is there?  Is it gotten better?  Is it gotten worse?  It's about the same.  Yeah.  Okay, so yes.  Some years, some years, other things...  You know, more things fall off than other years.  Right.  Every year, people do not secure their stuff well.  The one good thing is that the Burning Man organization  right after most of the people have passed through,  they come through and they work both sides  of the whole rez road from the moment they get in,  within our boundaries, all the way through.  So we know it does get picked up.  The problem is, people don't secure this stuff.  What should be there in the first place, right?  And I wish I can verify it.  I remember seeing on Facebook that for the 24 hours  after Burning Man,  the Furnley Transfer Station is open for free,  free dump disposals.  Right.  So there are people who are going to try to charge you,  you know, five, whatever, 10 bucks to dump your bag off.  The Furnley Transfer Station within the first 24 hours.  I know that the organization works with a lot of different resources in Reno as well  and in Sparks and so forth.  For many, many places that you can get rid of trash or building bicycles  and all that kind of stuff on the way back before you even hit, you know,  before you even hit Reno.  It really has gotten better over the years.  That's one thing we can't say because in the very early years,  the moment people would leave here and it would pretty much be  the first garbage hand they saw.  Right.  Oh gosh, things would just be loaded all around there.  And it's gotten better.  Right. And people, you're not supposed to like pull over at a business  and throw your crap in their dumpster.  But now if you go into like, say you've come through Wadsworth  and you're heading into Furnley,  loves has a huge,  what is it?  We're going to call those things.  The big dumpsters.  Sure. For people in the dumpster dumpsters.  So there are places and it has gotten better.  But it's just the thing I think that people don't like that happens a lot is  you're just not securing your stuff good enough.  Right. What about, so one of the things that we were told this year  was that a direct request from some of the local communities  was that people coming to the event were stopping in communities  and shopping in local businesses and they weren't dressed appropriately.  This can be, or what are your thoughts on that?  This is what we got that was direct requests from like chambers of commerce and so forth.  I've never heard anything.  Yeah, it's pretty much, you know what?  We all know this is what happens every year.  This is what people wear and they wear whatever they want to wear.  Yeah, if you don't like it, don't look at it.  It's just, it makes no difference to us.  Bob Zilla here with Heidi McCluskey and her daughter's Kayla and Cassidy  members of the Paiute Tribe locals who live in Wadsworth.  We are delighted to have them here in the studio.  You are the first Paiute Tribe members who have been here as far as I know.  We were going to talk about the current issues on the roads.  So there was, as you probably know, K-9 units  in the LM and Nixon and they were pulling over a lot of people  for what didn't seem like, in often cases, good reasons.  I mean, the thing is, so if you post someone over legally,  so we had a big talk about this earlier at the station,  you post somebody over for a traffic stop.  You know, they were over the center line or they were speeding.  And they were actually stopping people who were going to slow,  which is interesting.  They tried to roll through Nixon and stuff like five miles per hour under  just to make sure I'm good, but people were getting pulled over for too slow.  So they can do your traffic thing.  They cannot delay your stop.  So they stopped you for traffic.  Once that's resolved, they either set you or whatever.  They have to let you go because you're not under arrest.  So they can't say, hold on.  We'll have a dog team here in 15 minutes.  At that point, you're free to go.  But if they have a K-9 unit right there,  they can then the dogs can circle the car.  A sniff of a dog is not considered a search.  But if the dog alerts, they smell something of which many we were told are false alerts.  That is probable cause for them to then search your vehicle.  And then it goes downhill from there.  The word that we got was that the Bureau of Indian Affairs  in conjunction with the BLM  in an effort to aid President Trump's crackdown on the opioid crisis  was monitoring and was doing an enforcement action  on the highway because this was a major drug smuggling route  into and out of the event.  Now, later on, we heard from other people  that the BLM was not consulted about this  and that it wasn't coordinated.  So what's your take on this as a local tribal member?  Okay, well.  Then someone may be coming in to correct me.  No politics.  No politics, please.  This was, okay.  What was your opinion on it?  As a local member?  As a local member.  Me personally.  I have a resident.  So my resident, my resident, I got a crack wind shield.  I don't have plates on there because I was waiting for my tax exemption  thing to go through.  But I was wrong with it.  There was one other thing.  Oh, your vehicle.  Yeah.  So I had like three issues going and I was even scared to drive  because no matter what, it wasn't just you guys.  It was us too.  We were getting pulled over.  Yeah.  And I know, right now everyone wants to have a good time out here.  We don't want to really discuss politics and all that.  But it was something that this year was a little extreme.  It was something that threw not only you guys off, but us too.  Because if you think about it, it bears.  Basically, it goes Department of Interior.  Trump.  People have to say, you know, the guy on top.  Right.  Is the Department of Interior.  And then below that falls, the Bureau of Interior Affairs.  We aren't pleased by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  Locally not so like.  They're not the cops on the reservation.  We have tribal police.  Got it.  And do they answer to the BIA?  Yes.  But so the BIA has their own law enforcement branch.  Yes.  Got it.  If anything goes wrong, we are prosecuted under federal law,  not state law.  Federal law supersedes state law for us.  Right.  And so when something happens out there, even if it's a non-tribal member,  like one of Kayla's cousins was accidentally killed at the smoke shop.  He was ran over by a non-tribal and that person was prosecuted under federal law.  Got it.  Local police, your local tribal police.  Do they report to the Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement branch?  That's a good question.  I couldn't tell you that.  Okay.  And very quickly, let's talk on, you know, Bernie Mann is often cited as, you know, sometimes, you know,  we get the impression that the state of Nevada and some other people are trying to squeeze cash out of this.  It's a cash cow.  It's a benefit to the state of Nevada.  You know, people come and shop and they spend money.  How does that affect as a local member of the tribe and as a local person?  Do you see an economic benefit from this event?  Personally, no.  The only time it has actually, I feel the only time it's actually benefitted or impacted us.  When Bernie Mann has donated to the food bank, and this year, I believe they gave 8,000 something that directly trickles down to our tribe.  But yeah, they've done a lot of things.  There was the solar panel.  Exactly from Black Rock solar.  They've done it for natures.  They've done it for the elementary school, the high school, as well as the clinic.  Okay.  The museum, too, didn't they?  Yeah, I know. They've done a lot.  You know, for me personally, from the beginning to now, I think one of the best things that I've really noticed that Bernie Mann has had a solid impact, it's art.  The art, from save from the beginning to now, you see even art in, firmly you see art in Reno.  Well, let notes. So it's very clicky because we need to wrap up soon.  What do you think about the proposed growth of the population?  Growth through the event to 100,000 people?  I personally wouldn't like to see that at all.  I don't think our tribal members would either.  There are a lot of participants who don't want to see it either.  As it is now, when you guys are, when the burn happens and the whole freight train of car comes out, sometimes it takes us a long time just to get to the other side of the road, just to get to grandma's house, just to get home, takes a long time because these cars don't stop.  The impact of 100,000, I personally think it's just too much and I don't think a lot of our tribal members are too excited about that sort of population growth out here.  In general, yeah.  Sure. Okay.  I want to thank you guys for coming into the studio.  It's been a pleasure having you here.  Heidi McCluskey, her daughter's Kayla and Cassidy.  Thank you so much for coming.  Thank you for being good neighbors to us and I'm looking forward to a long friendship with you.  Thank you.  We're going to go out.  We'll go ahead.  One last thing I just want to give a wonderful shout out to our friend over in Paris, France.  Benoit, Henry.  He didn't get to come this year and I said I was going to give a shout out to him.  I want to thank you for letting me play my favorite songs and letting me just have a moment of a platform out here.  I don't know who hears this but this was very exciting for me and I want to thank you.  Thank you.  You are most welcome.",

And she  said to me, you're going to burning man, you're not 28, you know, you're 68. In fact I'm horrified  that you would make such a decision. And it shook me up for a few minutes and she said, well, I guess  you've made your plans already. And she's usually a very cool doctor. But we hung up. And for a  moment, I thought, am I too old to go to burning man, but I'm here. I'm in the time of my life.  I slid down a slide and fell on kind of on my face and everyone around me picked me up and said,  I did that too. And that was a perfect 10. And so I'm loving burning man.

Oh, shut the fuck up with you, mate.  Back in 1927, I had a little farm and I called it heaven.  Prices up and rain come down and I hold my crops all in the town.  I got the money.  Bought clothes and groceries.  Fed the kids.  Took it easy.  The rain it quit and the wind got high.  The black old dust storms filled the sky.  And I'll swap my farm for a Ford machine.  And I filled it full of this gas.  I lean and start it.  Rollin' in it.  Twistin' the California.  Way up yonder on a mountain road.  I had a hot motor and a heavy load.  As it goin' pretty fast.  I wasn't even stoppin' eyes about to nothin' down.  Like popcorn, a puffin' had to break down.  Sort of a nervous bust down of the...  mechanism there as I'm kinda in giant trouble.  His way up yonder on a mountain road.  I wasn't feeling so very good.  And I give this rollin' for to shove.  And I was a gon' coast as far as it could.  I'm instant rolling.  Takin' up speed and there was a hairpin' turn.  And I couldn't make it.  Land alive and I'm a tellin' you.  The fiddles and the guitars really flew.  That Ford took off like a flying squirrel.  And it flew halfway around the world.  It scared our wives and childrens.  All outside of that now.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  This dusty old dust is a blowin' me home.  I've got to be rolling along.  I'll sing this song, but I'll sing it again.

So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  This dusty old dust is a blowin' me home.  I've got to be drifting along.  Anyway, like I told you, the old dust storm hit there.  These people all congregated in their little houses.  And in the room in the house that I was in,  there was 12 or 15 people.  And the power was there.  Telling each other so long it's been good to know you.  Dusty old dust is a blowin' me home.  And I ain't got long to stay.  I've got to be drifting along.  Well, here's what happened.  The telephone rang and it jumped off the wall.  That was the preacher paying his call.  He said, look at the shape that the world is in.  I've got to cut price on salvation and sin.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  Dusty old dust is a blowin' me home.  And I ain't got to be drifting along.  The church houses were jammed and packed.  People were sent from front to the back.  It was a dusty.  The preacher couldn't read his text.  So he folded his specs and it took up collections.  And so long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.

The burn perimeters may be held longer than in previous years in order to let the heat  get down to a manageable level.  Please do not enter a burn circle.  You will be asked to move back into the crowd.  Remember, you are responsible for your own actions and to support those around you.  Get to know those around you.  Introduce yourself.  And if someone seems to be having a really, really bad day, call for help immediately.  The perimeter volunteer in front of you is connected to all the civic services of BlackRock  City, including medical and the Rangers.  They have people on call 24-7 who can provide judgment-free help through a difficult,  physical, emotional, or psychological experience.  All you need to do is ask them for help.  This goes double for anyone you see in distress after the burn ends and everyone starts leaving.  If someone next to you starts talking about rushing the fire, you can engage them calmly  and clearly.  You can tell them that every time we burn art, we are proving to the world that we can do  this safely.  And every time someone behaves unsafely at a burn, it puts the future of burning man in jeopardy.  If they listen, great, you've done the city of service.  But if they make moves towards the perimeter, point them out to a perimeter volunteer right  away.  And if they wander off, tell a perimeter person about the conversation, including details on  the person's appearance.  Do not try to physically restrain that person and definitely do not put yourself in harm's  way.  Point them out and let the perimeter team take it from there.  And finally, please keep tabs on your children.  Every year we get reports of families getting separated at the big burns.  Let's help each other stay safe out there.",

    "transcript": "Like four, what do you want to say here?  Let me pop you up here.  I had something I wanted to come up in.  I wanted to read for, actually, a few different years,  something I've written.  So it's really kind of, it's interesting,  because I haven't really got a perspective on it  until now, but I guess you could kind of call it a review.  This kind of my perspective from burning from 2011  up until 2016.  All right, well, what's your name?  Let's start with your name.  My name's Nate.  Nate.  Or Yoda here on plan.  Yoda on plan.  Well, go ahead, if it's not going to take too long, go ahead.  Yoda, everyone, Yoda.  All right, so I just wanted to kind of basically  as my experience from when I started burning in 2008, 2008,  but my experience from 2011, I mean,  the theme back in 2011 was right to passage.  And the man for the first time that year  was had the legs spread and taking one step  from one pyramid to another.  And this was done personally for me by the creators,  because the Burning Man organization applied for them  to be a nonprofit organization.  It was literally their own right of passage.  Simultaneously, the events sold out for the first time.  Circle of regional efficacies as well  that was picked the regions of the world  to have burner culture to come to the playa  and build an effigy to burn it on playa Thursday night  to be the largest burn in the world.  2011 core projects were united regions of burners  who were neighbors, but never knew.  The lottery was put in place much like a youth  turning to an adult in a tribe  being cast out of the privilege of being provided for it.  But they had to hunt out their own ticket  and gain their right to participate in the community.  The playa was riddled with first time burners  and the city experienced congestion and challenges  they'd never faced before.  And then it was a complete realized right of passage  by every participant.  In 2012, you had this theme of fertility.  And that was the thing that was really weird at all,  because often nine o'clock plus the theme cams,  all of the male centered interests,  while three o'clock plus the theme cams  were all female centered interests.  And I think to myself in this place  is like a Vitruvian man.  It's the Burning Man symbol.  From 10 and 2, it cuts through the man to the center  to create the arms and legs and the diamond to the deep playa  is the head, the temple is the 12 o'clock us.  We all exit out of the way that we entered through the groin  at six o'clock and rebirth back into the new world.  Now back to touch in 2013 in the theme  is cargo cults.  So it's about humans that were never touched by modern day,  by modern day man.  But they met soldiers in the world war  that viewed them as gods by dropping cargo from the sky  and being able to call flying machines  and beasts from the sky.  So no, so the event asked on our tickets,  who's John from, where are they really from?  And how can we, where is planet Earth going  on this existence?  Here's the thing.  The eye answered is John from, came from the soldiers.  John was the most common name, American name,  and they introduced themselves high on John from Los Angeles,  New York, Boston, Chicago.  But to them, it was all the same person  in separate bodies, or as a god.  In that year, the man burned asking three questions,  which were those.  So the cohesion of the three is that Black Rock City  received a massive indoctrination of secular religion.  So I think I've felt for the last three years  leading up to that point.  But now, religions, as set of rules, regulations,  and guidelines for spiritual principles and practices,  what's this new religion believes in is the individual.  When we believe in ourselves, it's  seemingly impossible, it becomes attainable.  The god, or higher power, or deity,  or effect of being outside of us,  is revealed to us in our everyday lives,  and we're empowered to follow our passions  of what our existence tells us to do.  And Black Rock City showed me that every role and position  has a place in a person with a passion to do it.  In society, we're forced against our wills  of their passions, to fill others' needs  in order to achieve their own passions.  That is, but here we're now.  We've always had the choice.  We've only just walked out of Socrates,  came to realize that when we pursue our passions,  we allow others to buy opening the space  that we occupy while in wait.  So where are we going, you ask?  Well, we're moving forward towards our true potential,  the flow, the optimal experience, as a race each of us,  each of us find our passions.  They ship Earth will not physically land anywhere.  They land on a new philosophical value that will allow us  what our chemical drives have always been leading us to.  A complete cohesion of existence  and coalescing of good and bad into a non-duistic being.  We all recreate and reinvent the God,  or higher power, or deity, in our own image as a planet.  Our own immaculate birth, so to speak.  So in one sentence, we end up writing  the big book in our own lives.  Now, what I really felt last year, what that year  was growing out, is outgrowing itself,  and the organization, and for the first time,  anyone international had a home base for people  from their countries.  Once again, leaving with more neighbors back home  than when we actually came with.  Last year was the first time I actually asked someone  in 20, that was in 2013.  So how many times have you been to the burn?  There's actually, yeah, it's my third time,  but my first time here.  So it started to sink in.  The community and the desert was no longer limited  to the confines of the playa.  The regionals had been pushed because they'd gotten too big  for it, just like it did at Baker Beach.  In 2013, the base was a flying saucer  with the core effigies grouped in four segments,  being in the four corners of the world.  So it refers back to the world wars,  drawing all dropping cargo in one place,  or take its red route, we will return.  I can't help but feel as though we were in a space  we called home, but suddenly felt as though  we'd been cast out of the way.  There's no cohesive feeling for the event I used to know.  So where were we doing out here in the desert  awaiting salvation?  Possibly abduction?  The abduction that occurred was in the frame of mind.  There's definitely a stagnant experience in that year  that we are going through the motions  awaiting the magic that we once be held.  When we were overtook a speculation  and concerned for where our values were leading our source  to a greater level of being,  we were no longer home, but alienated from the sessence.  In 2014, could air a vancery?  The man who had no base, core effigies were all suke.  The interactive gifting marketplace,  which will undoubtedly in my perspective  then would cause resentments in veterans causing them  to never really want to come back.  What are you talking about trying to sell something here?  The base was the man, but the base of the man was the suke.  The organization granted their wish,  was granted their wish and established their nonprofit status  that year.  They can no longer fund themselves,  but they could fund the regions.  In literal terms, the regions held the event up.  The man burning with the suke is the cohesion  of the event with the regions, all burning it once this year.  So if the organization is burning the event in order  for all of us to keep it because it fostered us meeting  together to create the very thing back home.  Number one virtue from 2014 was a gift is not something  that's wanted, it's something that's needed.  The public outrage over will chase this retraction  of the statement of the organization's profits  reminded me of a girl in the suko I named that year.  She was angry when I used the random plan named Generator  and I named her Dusty Wad and asked why it was so crappy.  I suddenly felt how her parents felt.  But I told her, that's what happens when you buy wholesale.  You get exactly what you pay for her.  And that's the thing is that we're all looking for someone  to fix this thing and it's up to us.  It's always been us.  And this is the gift that we've actually been needing.  The solution is the person next to us.  We need more people involved in order for a global connection  into happen as the orgas can support and flourish.  We're a mental and physical shareholders of the playa  when we're out here and we need to start acting  like instead of some trust fund kid you got burned  by the broker on the stock market.  It's not all over.  But this is the very act that started the event  in a larger and more eloquent way.  Larry Harvey burned a man on the beach.  Let go of a love they knew of being the beloved vent of 2013.  Only this time the man he burned is the event  in order to let go of the old frame of the event  and shift this overgrowth that makes that thing  in the desert an exclusive event  into an inclusive global community.  The 2011 core projects he started uniting regions  of burners who were neighbors but never knew.  Their rights of passage were for the first time  on their own making sure they got a ticket.  Instead of their parents cutting them off  and allowing us in 2012 we were fertility.  We were pollinating the globe with our culture  with one simple concise idea  similar to a hive mind effort.  In 2013 we were cargo cultists.  We continued to these traditions and rituals  that once brought unimaginable illumination  and hopes that would return and they would be among the magic  with our tickets reading and they will return.  In 2015 the years carnival of mirrors  and I'm hoping that in that year  we can all reflect on the communities  that we've built, the things that we've lost  and we've learned most of all the friends  that we've made in the communities that we've built.  We're all authors and we all wrote this in ourselves  into this book.  I'm hoping we see the reflections that of the magic  and the light and every one of us  have connected ourselves and make this new level of awareness  of what we've learned last and have achieved.  This new chapter of burning and burn our own men  in our own communities that we've created ourselves.  It's the one gift the organization leaves us  in the infrastructure to do it your own way  like they always have on the playa every year.  So in 2015 there was three questions on the ticket  just like in 2013.  It was who is the trickster, who's being tricked  and how might we discover who we are.  So these words would be kept in mind during the event  but the first question here is who's the trickster.  This question implies that there is a trickster  at the event we're all in one the same.  So simplify it a little bit.  If you ever looked yourself in the mirror  and wondered who that person is,  in most people's mind, they may feel tricked by their eyes  or senses based off the idea that they had themselves.  So when we see something that is us  but does not appear to be the same substantiation  feeling tricked is a definite perception.  So asking who is this trickster  may be a question of who are you?  Being a carnival of mirrors when we look at our reflection  and we see ourselves other than what we thought we were,  we experienced a separation of self.  One side is the perception of self  and the other side is the sense of self.  These two versions of us are both of us  but now the independent from the other  is brought to a conscious level.  This is one of both sides of the perception  start to ask the second question.  Who is being tricked?  This question implies that there's a deception going on  is my perception of self-tricking me into thinking  I look different than I do  or is my sense of self-tricking me into thinking  the person before me is myself.  Basically the difference between therefore I am I exist  or I exist therefore I am  or applied to the current affairs of burning culture  I am a burner therefore I exist  which exists on the playa  or I exist therefore I am a burner  which is the existence of the regionals.  So once we've arrived this double-ended question  the last question can be asked in the right context.  How might we discover who we are?  We're all a reflection of the Vitruvian man  I spoke of before came to fruition  is the centerpiece of the event.  Da Vinci is known as a man who's never finished  the work that he ever started  which is a behavior that was prevalent across the playa that year.  The man was not finished until Wednesday.  There's controversy over the money spent over a transport  of its 747 on playa to a giant dance floor  which flying machine mind you.  There's blatant sabotage of a massive theme camp  that gained notoriety of against the grain behavior  they had established towards the 10 principles of the event.  There's a lot of ambition in this year  that year and personally I feel I set a lot of people up  for disappointment in what they had set out to achieve  but as always the playa provides and we were shown  what all what hard work was.  Regardless of setbacks, regardless of heartache and disdain  we were shown what is truly important  and all of our efforts we look forward as them  as successes or failures all impacts the masses.  This year that year was about invention, innovation  and we look at them and study to uphold the principles  and communicate them to the newcomer.  I know showing up this year with a mission,  a golden goose or at least under the masses  that was definitely something I came with.  The only thing I can close with with this  from what I've gained from this year burning.  If you were here last year and you saw the base of the man  and you walked into the base of this year  there was a major similarity  and I feel like there was definitely a memorial  not only for Larry Harvey but what I haven't last year.  And the interesting thing is from the outside of the man base  it's just a giant circuit board, it's a wall  and what it turned into night was a natural firewall  and it's the same thing where the media  turns a lot of what happens out here  into something that it's not  and it's the only thing that anyone that doesn't come here  out here with you will ask you about  but what actually stays inside here is actual true meaning  and feeling and it's something that only all of us know  by being here.  That's what I got for you guys, thank you.  Nate, that was, that was pretty amazing.  I worked on the man base and so I'm like very connected  to what you're talking about with regards  to the evolution of the man base, Larry's themes,  the city and the community.  I feel there's definitely a common response that happens there.  It's a much bigger picture that you're looking at  and now you've just woken everyone up to see your bigger picture  and that's a bigger picture that I as a 18th year burner  definitely look at every day.",

    "transcript": "visible we are the less the less we're in hiding really it's it's a double  in short is that is that the more people learn about what trench gender is the  harder it is for us to pass well that's true that's true the other thing is  though is that as people get to know us and our community we are at less of a  risk of violence yeah because you do know us and you do know that we're just  fired right I mean the thing is it's you know there's always let's let's  throw in some other terminology the trap syndrome where you know you think you're  you're it's always it's always a guy and it's always a transgender woman who are  the traps and and the reason they're called traps is because the cis-gendered  guy feels that they were they were trapped and fooled and it's like I didn't know  you were trans and then gets violent and this is how transgendered people get  murdered yeah and that's because people are living in stealth mode this is  all another reason why I'm very very vocal and adamant about like I want more  visibility and yeah does that help you color oh yeah that absolutely makes sense  I appreciate the discussion in the back and forth on that and I appreciate you  tuning in from Clare down in hot land to my my nieces down there I love I'd love  that area awesome yeah all right so thank you so much and we'll  will wait for another car you're listening to BMI R the voice on your  FM dial oh there's a dial there you go boom there you go there you go there must  be a button David get in here for Mike one of you two oh this is for for eight five  eight BMI R eight four four eight five eight two six four seven let me do that  my girl voice ready that's pretty good copy of my R eight four four eight five  eight two six four seven that's like your phone sex worker voice I actually like  that should be your radio voice I like that I'm not gonna lie when I needed many  early in transition I did internet sex oh yeah wow well you got to pay for that  somehow you know no shame in that game yeah color you're we got a color you're on  the air hello hi who are you I am Amanda Amanda where are you calling us from I'm  from Dayton Ohio Dayton Ohio oh my goodness another Ohio in do you know how my  friend from up there she's one of my internet romances she's a gorgeous girl so  what's your question I was wondering whenever you go through the gender reassignment do you  lose sensation or do you do they cheat those nerves active in order for you to  enjoy sexual pleasure or that kind of different oh honey tight jeans in a  ride in my Jeep I could never have a orgasm driving in my Jeep as a guy tight  jeans in a Jeep I'm off to the races crazy wow and get this fantastic multiple and  two years ago this we last here rocked my world and I learned a thing that most  trans women I did I as a dude I never knew this existed after shocks she rocked my  world so hard a half an hour after we were done and cuddling I had another orgasm oh well you  want to super right now I actually picked a bad surgeon in Thailand I picked  Dr. Peachette oh he butchered the hell out of me I went to Marcy Bowers and she butchered me  again oh she's she was horrible so then anyway I found a plastic surgeon actually my friend  the one who transitioned at 15 she found a plastic surgeon in Salt Lake who fixed  everything but my nerve endings super girl I can have I can have  literal and vaginal orgasm wow okay that is amazing yeah that's absolutely that's  a classic but here's the thing that that experience is not universal there are I mean depending  on your surgeon just depending on how how your body takes to it you know you'll  hear stories is you know as successful as this one and then you'll also hear stories of  like yeah I don't really feel anything down there anymore but that's okay because in my head  I feel right you know it's really some of the surgeons are getting really progressive like in my  case so part of the tip of the penis where all of the super nerve endings are now mind you it's not  a sensitive as as a woman born with a vulva because of vagina has something like  our clitoris has twice the nerve endings that a penis does so we're taking the tip of the  penis and part of it was forms the clit and the other part some surgeons put up in to imitate  the sensitivity of the cervix and so that's why there's so much sensitivity up in the vagina that's  really interesting actually I have a wonderful close friend of mine who transitioned and went through  the surgery and unfortunately she rejected part of the inverted skin so damn yeah you know as  someone who has wanted to do the complete transition it was obviously very heartbreaking but the cool  thing about what she did was she was very open with it and shared it with her friends on on social  media yeah and and remove some of that that mystification of oh my god yeah what happens and shared  that and I you know I thought that was amazingly brave of her yeah I mean I love that the people  are taught I mean 20 years ago when I first started this process of you know figuring out like you  know transgender stuff there wasn't a lot of information out there was really like like the hardcore  information like nobody told me ever like I did not see this anywhere that when you start taking  female hormones you might just pee uncontrollably without like you you're and might just leak out of  your penis without you having any control over it wow and I'm like how is this not written anywhere is  this like this like dirty little secret that all the trans people don't want to talk about speaking of  this get this so let me talk talk to something else about this are you still there Amanda yeah so here's  the other interesting thing interesting factoid is is that that our vagina does not self lubricate  there are some new techniques they're using for sub lubrication I use actually a vaginal cream that  has estriol and estrogen in it and it helps me lubricate but when I'm actually being intimate if I  have an orgasm they have left the coppers gland and the prostate because those secret fluids that were  part of the seminal fluid part of the semen and so if I have an orgasm that fluid will leak into my  vaginal canal and then I I have lubrication huh that is so cool wow it's really it's amazing what  they can do a technology so I have to have looped a star but when I'm having sex if I have an orgasm  then I am having lubrication wow wow wow this was way more than you bargained for this this is exactly  perfect so I actually have a question and this one am I still on yeah you're all right so I heard  that they you know there are different surgeons that can do this procedure and you pick the one  that you like best because they have a specific technique so now my question is how is the technique  different I kind of thought you know just like this one thing you explained with the banana but  what different techniques are there can you say something about that well that's that it's a tough  one and in fact one of my friends back home just went to a surgeon in Austin I've never heard of  and did labia majora and labia manora at the same time we've had we've had to have I had two surgeries  and my labia manora is almost nonexistent I don't know if you look that close no but I can look  would you like to look here let's look again so if you look the labia manora that's pretty they're  really cute and dainty yeah that's pretty small pretty so this is one thing I was mad about when  I got home from Thailand I had this really nice plump clad and doctor powers cut like three  fourths of it out because she said real women don't have large clads listen as a former body  piercer and having seen I don't have more than your share yeah more than my bear share of people's  bottom bits I have seen you know very large cladrs is the size of my thumb and it's right and  and just to go on like this is going to be a weird little shift away from tranny but those women  are embarrassed a lot of times of their clad and and I've always encouraged like oh my god no you  are lucky to have that oh absolutely don't ever be ashamed of what you've got oral sex with a  large clad is awesome um so back to your question so here we go so back to the question it's it's  so there's it's called the um penile inversion technique is the one with the whole banana peel thing  I talked about there's some other techniques like you can do a a portion of your colon which gives you  more depth and the colon also self lubricates oh yeah the dilemma is a sometimes that comes with  an unpleasant odor the new technique is a take a part of the stomach lining it's it's I mean  it's cutting edge I'm talking about in the last 12 months they're they can take a portion of the  stomach lining and it self lubricates and it's still I would say still in the trial and error phase  because we don't have any longevity wow wow but the one but my friend who went to Austin  and I don't know officially what she calls that but but she said that her labia menora are as beautiful  and pronounced as her labia menora and the other thing for us because of the way the different  bodies are are labia menora which are the big leps for those of you who don't know these nice scientific  terms the labia menora usually look like deflated inner tubes so my plastic surgeon and salt lake  actually sucked fat out of my stomach and injected it into my labia and about 40 to 60% of it sluffs  off in the rest day so I had multiple procedures to get the labia the way they are wow  yeah I am so impressed well and I have to say it's it's really if you're if you're  MTF male to female your options for surgery is bottom surgery is so much better than FTM unfortunately  the female the female to male get all of the masculineizing passing we get the good bottom surgery  yeah yeah yeah well I think it's a lot easier to remove tissue than to have tissue I think  yeah really what it comes down yeah yeah there's an old really nasty saying what used to say  wait what is that I want to say well you take a hole then it is to build a pole wait it's easier to  take a hole then build a pole and what that means is that you can't we there is no way they tried  with with chicken tissue to try to learn how to try to make self-growing lit spongiosum so that people  could have a natural erection but they can't do that so female to male has a metoidal plastic which  is basically just using the enlarge the clitoris gets enlarged yes testosterone yes which ends up being  like it's a small penis or a nice way yeah and then they run a urethra up and then they expand the  labia put some prosthetic testicles in right and you're in small penis and then um  phalloplasty is taking a part of the forearm or a part of the thigh right creating a phallus  sewing it on and then putting a pump inside the dilemma is is again the tissue rejection  it has a pretty high risk right right and I'm assuming then if it's you know a form from something  that's not as sensitive as someone's actual genitals then sensitivity probably and again since women  start out with twice as many nerve endings in their clitoris right as the penis then you know  guys will default to staying with metoidal plastic because they have all the sensitivity right so  does that help Amanda that is so educational that was a lot so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna  clear the line and see if we can get another color is that okay Amanda absolutely have a great day  thank you for sharing thanks for tuning in and thank you for burning from afar yes  all right the line's clear so if somebody else wants to call in we'll do you have to play some PSAs  not yet night turns out oh yeah okay yeah because we build on the last group we'll just play  oh kinesle do you kinesle kinesle do you have a you have a question do you have a question to ask a  tranny kinesle uh uh uh uh not really it's like not really you just love this kinesle knows this and loves  us and has known us forever and I have one but let's leave some up here yeah um so oh there's a  here we go isn't that cool here we go actually yeah how do my nails look you know I was jealous of  your nails two nights ago so I had to go and do my own wait color are you there color are you there  oh hello hello who are we talking to this is harry nuts harry nuts where you call that is not your  name is it right now I'm not on play I'm in redondo beach redondo beach is in the house what do  it what do you have to ask a tranny today yeah I have a question on voice how does that fall over the  hole voice yeah your voice oh god it's such a struggle I'm gonna sound like girls can I take this one  you can hold that so here's the deal if you are female to male you're in luck okay you don't  your bottom surgery is not gonna be as good as you know as as a giant as yeah exactly they can make  a vagina better than make a penis but the good news is is when you start taking testosterone your  voice drops um and voices so it's such a it's it's I mean we're talking about passing so testosterone  makes the vocal cords lengthen and thicken it's why when you think of a piano string yeah the thinner  piano strings are high pitched and as the testosterone thickens the vocal cords the pitch drops  which is why when you're going through puberty you're getting you know jolts of testosterone to your body  and your voice changes if you're born male and you know your voice changes as you get older so when  you um if you're born female but you start taking testosterone you basically go through puberty  and your voice drops however if you're born male and you start taking estrogen well too bad your  vocal cords already thickened the estrogen will give you will soften your skin it will give you  breasts it will do all sorts of things but it will do anything for your voice so yeah you have  to do vocal training and vocal coaching and we have lexie with us and lexie and and notice we all  have different voices because some of us are more spot on with our if we're on our game color  so I actually did some theater I did some some I worked in the film industry a little bit so I  was able to have access to some pretty good coaching so if I'm really on and I really want to make  sure you think I'm a cisgender woman I'm going to talk really feminine and up and down and sing  songy I mean there sadly there is some truth to that um like you would think I mean I feel like  most at least maybe like a lot of feminists would think that's like really absurd right like  what why is that the indicator but it's it's a number of factors like it's just like with passing  in general there's a num this like it's like additive right it's like it's like one thing could  not knock you off the horse and it totally changes somebody's view but it's but in general it's like  it's like what's the facial hair looking like blah blah blah blah and and it's the same with voice  there's there's there's a pitch thing there's a placement thing and then there's like the speech  patterns like you're saying right and and it does make a difference and I mean I I don't think I'm  I really like uh put on ears when I speak but but it does make a difference and it's really like  it I mean it's a fence it if it offends my it offends me that that that makes such a difference  it makes me really angry and I think the three of us you have the most struggle naturally feminine voice  well I I have a lot going for me I was a professional singer I went to a grad school for singing  and so I already had a mind like attention to it and then I spent a lot of time with voice therapy  with Christie Block in New York City so so yeah I mean I mean it made it made all the difference  it made all the difference I thought I thought color what do you mean the color does that help you  the color yes yes color I want to know that there was training involved to other than just the  testosterone estrogen that part of the diodenal there's any surgical thing they did on the voice  box there are there are some surgical techniques where they stretch the cords and staple them down  they've had some real bad side effects from that so I don't encourage it yeah there's um there's  a new a newer technique that uses lasers from South Korea right and there's been a higher success  rate with that but still not like not not fantastic and the lasers kind of burn off part of the vocal  chord so they have thinner vocal chords that was my question so they actually make the chords thinner  I see it's like it's like strings on a guitar the fat ones are obviously your bass and you get down  right yeah but there's still there's still limitations um anyway like they're you're not um change  you can't really change the carriage and that works that works for I mean that that works against  trans men as well like you'll get a thickening in the vocal chords but it's depending on my age like  the right and and you'll get you'll get a develop like a Adam's apple kind of development but you  will you won't like the larger cage won't like it's grow because the bad start from a certain age  in just in general your bones fuse and you don't hear bones don't grow right and those of us in the  community trans men's voice kind of gives them the way because they all kind of have some voice  sometimes but yeah I mean they'd say there's nothing consistent but there are some things that pop  up again and again part of the reason why I'm open and and do this education is because I want to  demystify and so when you see us and we're different we're just different we're just less common we're  not less than we're simply less common absolutely okay so I'm gonna clear the line and I'm gonna play  some promos that caller thank you so much for calling him from a door to beach I forgot you thank you so much  thank you very much right call in very great to participate off fly a love you thank America and I hope  to be out there and next year and be able to thank you and both rest the community thank you there you  go next year was better anyway right but earlier there was talk about being born male and then  transitioning being born female and that's terminology like as a new school or whatever whatever  that uh that I strongly object to like I I mean everybody's got a different conception of themselves  and if you think you were born male and then whatever but not everyone can see it themselves that way  and I think it is I mean I don't think it's like a flight of fancy to for me to say that I was born female  and and I was a birth defect yeah I mean I there was normally no no I mean that's a common way of  of of of justifying yet but I don't think I need to justify it you know word you don't know anybody  adjustification so are you you're you're basically you don't like the term born yeah this is why  you probably a sign male assigned like a well also in in terminology um a mab or a fab which is  assigned yeah we were we were we were man who transitioned a women or we were right but in the new  the new vernacular it's it's assigned male at birth yes what did your birth certificate say and  doesn't match who you are but there's like lots of reasons for that because uh uh uh you get  in this whole argument of whether not only is is gender a construct which I that's the one I that's  the one I object to I think I think gender is very very real I don't think it's invented but but then  you get to the point is is is what's biological sex and I think biological sex is the I'm not the first  person to say this but I think biological sex is the construct do you have this wide spectrum of how  people are born and we're just like obsessed with with a physical polar ideals of what a man and  a woman are but there's so many so many people are born not matching that ideal either like a genetically  or physically are for so many different reasons speaking of which I have a great massive aversion to  the gender reveal party the gender what oh the gender reveal where were you hit a balloon and it's  pink duster blue baby is he meaner for two people yeah I really really bugs me every time I see  that I'm like I hope your kid grows up to be transgender yeah I inspired my I host karaoke at home in  New York and I inspired my bar I mean my bartenders is open-minded lovely human being John but um  he just had a second baby and for both of the kids like you know we've been working together for 11  years and so he's been he was through me you know at my side through everything and um he uh he  named both of his kids um clever and in and and compelling but gender neutral names um uh robin and  ember to see you know the cuz just because like if they just you know let them have the freedom of  doing whatever they want to oh we have another collar take for calling collar you're on the line  with ask a tranny at bm IR with whom do we have the pleasure  are you there color are you there hello oh color oh oh try again color how about that oh there we go I  had to move a dial that was a that was a peb cac care okay who are you hi this year pal Henry  from Salt Lake City oh my god Henry what's up we need you here bro yeah you need a chance  masculine presence in that yes yes we do we do I'm doing my best but you know can I say no we need  every perspective in here we have we have we have we have uh three well we have two chance we've  been in here and and uh did you say I identify I'm pretty much trans I'm non-binary trans feminine  right but we need every perspective in here and I'm so glad I'm so glad to be up to play alone on  on I got a cell box here I'm so glad you called because we do absolutely need a chance masculine uh  presence and a non-binary presence because it's like people it's it's part of what keeps all  of us all of us down is this like fetishization of trans women and and and and uh looking down upon  a femininity it like screws everybody up and so like people need to know that trans men exist in our  presence and like I don't know I feel very strongly about it so please go on and actually me want to  speak yes not just not just strong and silent and and and for you listeners Henry Henry brought me  to Burning Man five years ago oh wow oh wow he's like the most you're welcome everyone yeah he's the  most kind of gentle um man you'll ever know and and so Henry thank you again for for getting me out  here to the ply and getting me connected via my arm so now we're all gonna shut up and give you  just yeah Henry I want to hear what you have to say well I'm just on my way to work and I just  had to pull over for a second because of what was just being said about this binary construct of  biological sex um it really it just spurred me to call in because I wanted to say something about it  because I work as a primary care physician and I do a lot of work with people with hormone not  for transition just for balancing for them to feel like themselves with their hormones going  crazy for whatever reason and I do see so much variation in these levels of hormones that fall  outside of what we're taught in medical school that you know here's the normal range of testosterone  for a female and if you go outside of that you'll have all these horrible side effects and you have to  do something to suppress it and it's just I have this other perspective on it and I just encourage  people like it doesn't you know you can be female and have a testosterone level naturally of 75  which would be way outside the normal range but it's not normal for you it's fine exactly those  norms are are invented by people that's why that's the whole argument behind the biological sex is  a construction of of humans and and we it's imperative that we come to a world where that's okay  we're having that with being female and having that testosterone count is okay it's imperative for all  of us to move forward and it's about balance and it's about getting people to feel their best and  there's no set normal there's no this thing is not there is no normal it's quote unquote white  there's common I love you guys and yeah thank you my call and we wish you were here yeah we do  we we wish you were in the studio we need to we need your advice and I know you don't want to come back  but next year come back oh he hits warned to me he's never coming back I've heard that before  we'll have to make a not offering can't refuse love offering you're on the line with BMI are ask a  tranny oh my god I am so excited and who are you babe can I call you babe without offending you I'm sorry  I am calling from Sacramento California sacked out in the house totally I love the donut place  no marie's donuts and it's like it's killer because when you go to prep sorry to talk  love look at the radio yeah well because when you prep when you win someone yeah outside of Sacramento okay  that are transitioning male female and one is a beautiful woman the other one is struggling  and in my untrained eye and you know so one is what we call passing I don't know so well I know  she get um called out a lot called out in my way and and struggles with this transition whereas the  other one seems to be just flourishing yeah well I don't know how to help so so this this is the  unfortunate part of our community I have I have a different out here in the play that that we clashed  the first couple of years partially because I was a douche but but but what was they it's a long  story for not for this show okay anyway last year we connected in a different way we've been  Facebooking and they because they go by the gender neutral pronouns they called me out one time  and said you know it's all right because you're beautiful and you pass I will never pass so I have  to live in the gender um what the gender danger zone if you will because I will never pass and that's  a reality that I hope with my education that we quit shaming people for not looking girl enough  or looking boy enough or or WTF ever you know you bring up a very valid point and I have friends  back home that also will never pass well however it doesn't change the fact that they feel like they  feel well I agree with all that but what what was your question actually you laid out the situation  what was the question I don't know I'm phobic I feel I feel bad I said that I I mean I don't I see  this I don't want to see this you know like you don't want to see color right yeah right well I don't  think there's anyone who's like earnestly trying to wrap their heads around this I don't think  anyone should feel bad because if if the if the world I mean if if the world were in a different  position we wouldn't need to be asking these questions like if we were not in the ideal world yeah  that's the whole process this is why we're on the radio yeah especially with the political  world we have in Trump Estonia but community right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well I mean my  my I don't my recommendation for that is like we can't prioritize people who pass but but you  got to have you got to kind of reconsider your friend as just like any other woman who's who's  having strong who's having struggles it's like I know I really I used to equate passing  issues with like a disfigurement and in other kinds of disabilities I definitely try not to do that  anymore I think it's offensive to both parties but but if you can conceive of it somewhere in that  realm of like the the the two women are essentially in the same oh actually all three of you are  essentially in the in standing on the same ground and you're dealing with different interfaces with  the world and that's the kind of that's the kind of you kind of have to equate those things to have  the right compassion like this is your fellow you know fellow woman walking the world and she will have  some of the same struggles that you do and and and some different struggles and and and you also have  to kind of like try to imagine how how how frustrated and and how much it would drive you mad to be  face I can't even imagine and struggle let me interject something that may help you and she's also  anonymous and they would not allow her in an all-feeling meeting all the time in the lesbian world too  yeah it's challenging I'm that was that was huge and let me let me give you let me give you an  example of how this affects all of us not just trans women my neighbor across the street I'm five  foot 13 my neighbor across the street is also five foot 13 she's she was assigned female at birth  my neighbor is is is was assigned female she's having a female she's she's happy being a heterosexual  woman her partner her husband is amazing guy she gets misgendered all the time because she's tall  and big and looks masculine yeah and and we became really good friends and neighbors when I moved  into that neighborhood and then one day she comes up because can we go to coffee we got a copy my child  just came out as transgender and I don't know what to do so here we are these three women in this  neighborhood two of us are transgender and one is cisgender yet we all get misgendered wow yeah so  it's it's not just a struggle of of transgender one at my job I worked for the state of Utah at one  time in in the human services department and a woman in the cubicle next to me was almost bald  on the top of her head and she's also female she just had alopecia right and she would get misgendered  so when when we when we when we do transphobic things when we when we call call out if you will  transgender people because somehow we think that they're less than and we get to do that we're also  harming women in general or harming the divine feminine and in so doing we're also harming the  divine masculine yeah we're harming everybody when that when the when the bathroom bill started coming  around in North Carolina and all this so then she started proposing them there was a huge increase  in cis women trying you know people trying to deny access the bathroom to cis women and and because  you don't look girl enough to be in our girls bathroom right right right phone lines are open btw  you keep that thought like eight for four eight five eight two six one seven or two six four four six  oh I was seeing it from my angle it's BMI are eight four four eight five eight BMI are and in our two six four six  four six boys eight four four eight five lines are open  okay I see I saw Kinnisla out there I saw um I mean Becky Joe has oh here we go  and excuse but people outside need to come in and ask those questions color you're on the air with  that's good dranny hello hi hi hi I'm Colleen from North Carolina um speaking of you guys to  return to the thought of how misgendering people can damage the divine female and the divine masculine  or sacred or however you want to use that language I have some of my life who is resistant to  using the appropriate gender for people and it's been a discussion ongoing for years with him  and this is a new angle on it that I think he might actually hear and might resonate with him um and  I'd like to hear more of anyone's thoughts who'd like to contribute well so in in my spiritual practice  I grew up in a very um very binary uh very Christian Mormon family uh I was exchange student in  in Mexico and lived with very much a a devout Catholic family my my in-laws are Mexican my ex-in-laws  are Mexican so I very much understand the the Christian dynamic I studied history and world  religion so I understand the Abrahamic religion dynamic thank you so much my doll we just got  some buttons and I'm in love so so I have left I have left the Judeo Christian Islam Abrahamic  thought and I live in more of a an eclectic spiritual world in which my basis is the Native American  medicine will and the four agreements of the Toltec philosophy so I I participate in different  ceremonies and swat lodges and and it's interesting the swatlage ceremony is a renewal and the  swatlage is considered the womb of mother earth and we go into the womb of mother earth and do a  life cycle yet almost all the lodges are controlled by men and it's another way that men are controlling  femininity and it hurts my heart so I started out being the super angry feminist being mad at my  previous male self who was a very much patriarchal misogynist prick and and I became this angry  feminist lesbian and then I was in this ceremony and and it came to me and in my mantra my spiritual  teaching when I lead a swat lodge or when I lead a retreat is that this world is not going to heal  until we embrace the divine feminine now in some worlds in some communities in some spiritual  circles that means that we get rid of patriarchy and bring in matriarchy again and and I propose to you  that matriarchy and patriarchy are both systems of one in control of the other so we divine we embrace  the divine feminine and at the same time we embrace the divine masculine misogyny is not the divine  masculine and and being controlling angry women is not the divine feminine we come together and the  divine feminine divine masculine embrace and simply become the divine and we quit living in this  binary world of boys and girls and whatever well we need to do that anyway I mean that's the  construct is I mean again if if if we're misgendering somebody because again we don't see them as  simply less common we see them as less than right if he misgenders someone to me that says more  about him I agree I mean if people people compensate no I mean even in your example of your own life  like someone will someone will might try to attack swinging from like this you know misogynist  kind of person to to to self identified radical feminist to finding somewhere in the middle as like  as like fake or wishy washy but it's just you people people I mean everyone has their struggle  and and and trans people have struggles and people compensate I mean it's same with all the politicians  who come you know get outed like people have people overcompensate to try to make sense to their  worlds and and and I have compassion for that not not disdain I have I have yeah I'm and I have  I like to add to the to the divine feminine kind of conversation and answer it in a very like  unspiritual way I have a spiritual practice and I'm actually I'm a full-time DJ but I'm a professional  terror reader and astrologer as well and and but I did nevertheless I'd like to answer this in a very  like mundane kind of way absolutely um nobody wants to be reduced to their parts no woman  wants to be I mean maybe maybe not but you know I can at least say I think I think it's it's  many women don't don't want to be reduced to to you know to being a sex object yeah  subject and no one wants to be defined by their body parts people want to be appreciated for  being a human being and whatnot and I yeah I think I think the concepts of masculinity and femininity  while you know while I think they're they're they're they're more vaguely defined and more fluid than  we allow them to I mean I think they're things that it exists and obviously the people care about  and and I think we should make a special effort to redefine them not based on body parts for everyone  saying I mean it's a classic example but I have a friend you know I have a friend in this position  if if you're a cis woman and you uh don't you either lost or don't have the ability to conceive  that does not make you a less of a woman true and as this and as you know you just extend that  argument to to to the trans experience I think it's I think it's I think it's simple  these are secretly struggles and I'm trying to help him shift with uh people who  identify as non-binary with day-appropriate yeah I think tell him I love him and I invite him to see  the world in a different way I mean we're all in this together too like trans people don't get  a perfect either trans trans people I mean binary trans people often have to have trouble wrapping  the minds around non-binary experience and you know there's a lot of what they call internalized  trans misogyny so like you know like trans women or I mean trans people general but I speaking from  experience trans women can be really really harsh on themselves or other trans women or other women  in general for for certain standards and uh it's all it's all rough and it's it's it's it's we're all just  like trying desperately to to to not topple the jenga tower and try to try to make sense of our world  so I mean I you know it's just it's complicated I think I think I think one of the biggest takeaways  about the discussion it just the the broader discussion is that it's not simple you do you do you  do everybody has a different conception of gender everybody thinks that most other people share their  conception of gender even though everybody has wildly different or you know gradation you know different  and uh and uh and it's not you can't boil it down to one thing like everybody's got a piece of the  puzzle it's not you can't boil everybody try think many people try to boil gender down to to one  principle or one mechanism or a couple mechanisms and like oh it's all about that and it's not it's  about all of it some you know some of it is is behavioral some of it is biological and it's just  big hodgepodge that that we as you know um in our multitudes and uh you know in our in our in our  great variation of humanity we're we're just trying to make we're just trying to you know like like  with everything we're trying to group it in ways that make sense so we can process our world and  we just have to massage those groupings and and and we evaluate those groupings does that help  yeah thank you for your first sentence oh thank you for calling in too I learned a lot so I'm so glad  hey that's you know that that makes my heart just sing and and I'm so glad you're turning into  BMIR out there in the default in and um I'm glad we get to bring this piece of home to your home  to your other home so I ran out I'm sorry Collar okay so we're gonna just we're gonna work it  off the lines again thank you for calling in hey yeah so I ran out the the lounge because uh  Becky our campmate who of course injured herself pretty bad today can not now walk into the studio um  we love Becky we love you so much we're sorry you're stuck out there um anyway she wanted to get back  to just the word tranny for a moment and she wanted to make a comment and and kind of thank you  for using the word because you know as uh she thinks that what you're doing today and using it is  normalizing the word and making it less mysterious less of an epithet if it happens um and she also had  a question about it and that was after the show now when someone comes over to the camp they're they  are gonna find you and camp and go dumb oh you did the tranny show are you gonna be okay with being  that tranny and I know the answer to this wow uh and and and no you don't because no I'm not oh wow  no I'm actually surprised so say more about this so and here's the reason why yeah it goes back to  what we talked about at the top of the show yeah um Adrian and I own that term and we get to because  we've earned that yes guessing right with 20 plus years of absolute bullshit pardon me  I really think that the easiest way to break this down in terms that everyone understands is  tranny is the t-word as the n-word is to the African-American community we get to say it  you don't yeah in that sense I love that I think it I think it I mean I I want I would like to  suggest that it's not a direct parallel but are there are some very strong similarities yeah  and and I would concur with that yeah because because because the t-word has  20 years of bad history and the n-word has century but some of the similarities include uh uh you  know the word being reclaimed and being used in various various different contexts by various  different people and like that I don't know if people are aware but there's this whole um controversy  for a hot second with um RuPaul oh yeah because in the in the drag community and in the the  the gay male community uh and like cross-dressers and uh so forth um they they used it uh amongst  themselves uh as a as a term of a deerman and um whereas people like us it's used against us as  violence and and I think both of those usage are valid I mean they both have a history and  and I you know I value and honor the experience that those people have in those in those scenes  but we're in a different world now and if we're if we're in it together I mean it's the issue of  intersectionality if we're in it together we yeah we gotta we gotta agree to stop stop doing that we  gotta we have to agree that it's that it's that it's that it's that it's that it's because it's a  word used in violence that we we need to move away from it but is it really though I've never like I've  gotten I've gotten yelled at I've gotten scared yeah but it's always we talked about this earlier  where I was like like training was never a an epithet it was I mean it was it it was always a  term of a deerman I never heard that someone yell yell you know no one no one yelled from a passing  car hey traini and I have I have I mean there's there's various levels here like we live in we live  in a bubble and like you live in a very liberal bubble so that's one thing and nevertheless I mean  I I haven't been yelled at no one's yelled traini at me in San Francisco but but someone yelled  back at me you know yeah now that I've gotten to yeah I've gotten faggot right I've gotten freak I've  gotten all these words yeah but never training yeah it's like I think the I think we here's the  thing about ask a trend we're gonna bring shwaggy out from New York so stand by shwaggy here's the other  thing you can ask you can ask a hundred transgender people a question and you're gonna get a hundred  definitely any should and you say so shwaggy thanks for joining us on the show what what what can  we help with mate hi I just wanted to say first I hope everyone's having a great burn we are thank you  I'm sorry I can't be there with you on flyer I'm doing couch burn for New York City  haven't been to the fly in a while but I'm watching live stream on YouTube and listening to show  so I feel like I'm with you uh with my heart and maybe some of my old camping buddies that  cost you call for listening to uh the broadcast so I had a costume called hi this I'm uh this is  uh ill-exandered from New York I play for costume called you mate you have seen me you gotta go see you gotta  go see my question uh what you know everything is changing so quickly with this kind of I don't even  know what to describe it just you know you guys just dynamic or that it's it's very dynamic it's  different than when you were younger and so how is someone he I don't even know the right terms to  use I'm sorry I identify as a gay male I don't know I really don't know much about it I'm trying  to understand it better but how do we you know how does someone who's not does not identify this way  you know how can we educate ourselves and try and stay current and sensitive to you know what's  happening yeah I mean you're doing it right now first of all you're engaging in the dialogue and asking  they're asking yeah you know everywhere I know I know I'm trying to think of all the things I've  done in the last two decades plus um I was at a Western state's conference and the director of the  New York gay and lesbian communication it was out and and she was a cis lesbian who who did a lot of  trans inclusion so look I would say look first to your pride center and if they don't have  transforming then ask them to bring it in yeah um find people like uh Alexandra to to have her do some  education yeah we can get coffee when I'm back in Brooklyn there you go and and and I and I um the  Google the YouTube I mean there are so many trans channels on YouTube now that you can watch so many  cool stuff yeah I mean I'm not a young guy but it's really interesting my my niece is a lot  younger you know in high school and she's got friends who are trans and one of her friends in particular  you know identifies as I'm not even sure you know trans are non-binary or not I think non-binary  yeah non-binary is definitely giving it's sometimes she wants to be called a she sometimes she  wants to be called a day and this is fluid and changing yeah so you know I just I always ask my  niece if I ever see her friend what am I supposed to well you can I I as a non-binary  binary person can say when in doubt you will never go wrong with they yeah um yeah and it's and all  of us I I have not found one transgender person who is offended by which pronouns do you prefer  yeah I do I am the exception at rule I think I think logically it makes perfect sense that you  should ask someone who's what their what their pronouns are but it shakes me it messes up my whole  day when someone asks me that if they like that that that that they that they that they did it even  crosses their mind that's the dysphoria speaking I get it yeah I mean it's mostly on me but I  can't I'm driving nuts so is that so how do you prefer I I point people to to assume that I am female  and you use right so and not have to ask me so this comes down to you are feeling you're a woman  yes you see yourself as a woman yes and so I can understand how it's distracting toward to your day  and turns you down because it hurts the passing thing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's internalized  transfobia right right absolutely yeah and I have it as well I if somebody if somebody misgenders me  it hurts deeply because I'm like and here's what I've learned though and and a friend of mine taught me  this they were in a grocery store and somebody called her sir and she's just like she walked out and  she she said I got my grocery cart or the room I was so angry and she said wow it hit me and I  turned around and I went back and asked that person why did you do that and and she said I wanted to  know what social cues I was putting out and again social cues shouldn't freaking matter but they do  we live in society yes it's like I mean that's where the you know social society these are all  you know I have a couple of other things so so as much as I know I think they're really like  these air real fast you know I have a bunch of things okay well there's a second thing I think it's  really important that to acknowledge that there are no people color this room yes yes absolutely they're  they're we aren't burning man we are burning man no people color I hear and I'm I know for a fact  they're trans people of color out here but but multiple but the the the trans experience is  challenging walking through the world as a person of color is challenging and please make a special  effort not out of pity uh to out of honoring and honor to reach out to trans people of color because  it's a very isolating I'm about to cry actually there's a very isolating and white tears white tears  it's a very isolating experience so please don't talk down to them don't look at them with pity but  oh somebody cut me off please don't talk down to them don't look to look at them with pity but  please see with compassion someone who's potentially an isolation and and and make an effort to say  hi and to emphasize to emphasize your point 80 percent of the anti gay violence is perpetrated  against people who don't fit in gender true 80 percent of that is against trans women of color color  so so um so we're we're going to end the ask a tranny show and the next show coming up you all  are going to be amazed can I can I can I say one thing yes please uh I thank you so much for inviting  me in to do this because that's the head the token right sis head male I appreciate and I love you  ladies I must say I really really appreciate this and I love you really Lexi and sexy Lexi  what's that Adrian I'm going to be the DJ I love you yeah cut us off cut us off cutting your  mics I'm cut it okay now it's just me on so here we go",

    "transcript": "Hey, I'd like to talk to you about consent.  What is consent?  Well, consent is crucial in many situations, mind altering substances, photography, and  sexual activity, for example.  Sexual consent is an agreement between people about what should and should not take place in  a sexual situation.  Now consent is the bare minimum required for legal and ethical sexual activity.  Consent requires people to be 18 and over, properly informed, not under coercion, and  insufficiently sober.  If you're not sure about any of these factors, then you cannot assume consent has been given.  Silence is not consent.  Nudity is not consent.  Drunk, not consent.  A sleep is not consent.  Only a clearly expressed yes is consent, and consent can be withdrawn at any time.  To be sure about consent, communication is necessary.  Now we get it, communicating about sexual consent can be scary.  Any of us are afraid it's going to be uncomfortable or awkward, or we're going to be rejected.  But communication is absolutely essential.  Talk to your prospective partners or friends about your desires and your boundaries.  Some people like to say that they have no boundaries, but in reality they probably do and just  may not know what they are until they're crossed.  Always be prepared to renegotiate boundaries if they have been crossed, and don't interact  with anyone who is not interested in your desires and boundaries.  Really.",

Octopussy fingers.  These are fingers with long tentacles  and succulent little biscuits on them  that come in and they tickle your face and your shoulders.  And if you want a massage from something  that's across between a shrimp and an Octopussy.  You're in delight mode from the Octopussy.  Winchester is literally the only person here  who has enjoyed my Octopussy fingers.  Wait, I love them.  Oh, you like them too.  I didn't tell you yet because I love them.  Can you remember?  Everyone else thinks they're creepy as hell.  I'm so happy there's a couple people here  who actually enjoy these.  I'm looking forward to a massage  with like several people with Octopussy fingers.  I mean, can you imagine?  It's like, do we have a tickle camp?  I bet I'm sure there's a tickle camp.  There's a one-wear one guide right there.  You probably find one, I'm sure.  Okay, well.  These have suckers on them.  When do you find an Octopussy finger with suckers?  Not very often.  And they're just such a beautiful shade of pink.  And they are.  They're really are.  The shade of pink that makes you wonder  why you're in the Octopussy fingers.  They're a shade of pink that makes you turn the shade of pink.  Oh!  Oh, I got some.  I was gonna do something.

    "transcript": "I was building, came out here for early entry, and we were building or erecting kind of a sculpture for our camp, and at some point, I must have gotten a metal shard of some point embedded in my eye.  Now, it kind of just looked like a freckle or something, just sort of in my eye. It kind of felt like when maybe sunscreen goes into your eye and it kind of just stings.  It was kind of a minor annoyance, but I tried to wash it out a few times and didn't really see me working, so I was like, okay, I should probably get checked out.  So I went down to rampart, and we talked to one of the paramedics, and I think you went through probably an entire bottle of saline and tried to flesh out my eye. It just didn't see me working.  So, finally, it goes, okay, let me go talk to someone, and he goes inside, and this surgeon comes out, and takes one look at me, and he goes, yeah, that's metal, that's not coming out.  So it goes, okay, I come inside, we need to get this out like ASAP. So we go inside, and this doctor was pretty cool, he had a mohawk, we're sitting around talking about metal, we were making jokes about like, oh, you're having the most metal day ever out here.  And I remember I turned to him, and I was like, yeah, the only thing missing is Slayer's Raining Blood, and yet a Bluetooth speaker, and if he goes over and turns on a Raining Blood, it was fantastic.  And then he turns to me, and he goes, okay, joking aside, we're surgically removing this. And I'm like, okay, and he goes, okay, pick a point at the ceiling and just stare at it, and he comes in with the needle, and starts just picking this thing out of my eye.  And he kind of explained to me that your eyes don't have a whole lot of nerve endings, so it wasn't too painful, just incredibly uncomfortable.  But he just sort of said, pick a corner at the ceiling and just stare, and from there he got it out, but then there was rust in my eyes.  They had to take the same needle and carve out two layers of my cornea, and then to top it off after they got that out, they gave me a tetanus shot in my eyeball.  And this all sounds pretty intense, but I would say this all took place over the course of maybe 20 minutes, and I came back to camp, and basically I was like, man, you guys are not going to believe what just happened to me.",

    "transcript": "Sadly Arnold passed away, not a couple months after Burning Man, yet we'll fill you in on that, but tonight yet is back in BlackRock City with her BMI, our family, and we are bringing you a program to remember Arnold.  Are you there?  Yes, I am.  Okay, talk so I can see what microphone you're on. There you go.  Well, we were here last year with Arnold, and you were welcome. It's special. We immediately feel like we were here with family, and Arnold was so happy to be here.  And I didn't know anything about Burning Man when I met him. I only knew him for three years, and that's sad on one side, but I think I'm really grateful that I've known him for the three years I had.  So we should wonderful moments. When did Arnold become ill?  The end of 2017 he became ill. He had kind of stomach pains, not really severe to start with, and then that it's some research, that it's some things in the hospital, and at first it seemed okay. He got some pills, and we should try that for like a few months, but it didn't work.  After Christmas, actually the day after Christmas 2017, he went back to the doctor to get another exam. Is that an exam? You call that examination?  Yes, yes.  And then immediately it was, we knew it wasn't good. So, well, they do a lot of them to repeat that, and I think after two weeks we got the message that all the diagnosis that it was stomach cancer,  and that everything they could do was give us time. So that was harsh, but actually at that moment, he asked me to marry him, so that was really special.  So Arnold was, when you guys came out and camped at BMIR in 2017, Arnold was already knew that he had cancer, correct?  When we came to camp with you? Yes.  Yeah, he already had like a lot of treatments, and actually in operation to remove his stomach.  He was in hospital for like three weeks in a really good hospital in Holland, which is specialized in cancer, and he participated in like a research.  Right, experimental treatment.  Yeah, which was very heavy to go through and to recover from, but he did really, really, really well.  Even the doctors were impressed by his progression, and by spirit, because he just believed that he was going to be okay.  He actually built like a garden, a cabin in our garden after he recovered from it.  And right before we came here, he had to go to hospital to get the approval, because it's a long trip.  Exactly.  And they actually said that given a spirit and given that he was eating well, and he was gaining weight, and he was looking good, and he was like happy and really decisive to survive.  And he said, well, I think you're okay for now. So we were really not only happy to be here, but also very positive about the future when we came here.  So it felt like a new start, or like, you know, very positive.  And then when you guys were here, he, you know, some complications arose, correct? And you guys had to leave?  At first, he felt really great and happy, and he was like enjoying every single, not moment, but second of it.  He was happy to be at the hospital.  He was so happy.  He was truly at home.  He was truly at home, and I remember, because I've been here a week talking to everybody, talking to the family, and everybody has some memories about him.  One really good memory of me is like he was playing kiss and ride, so when I came into the lounge, and I saw the kiss cushions, is that work?  Yeah, cushions. You saved from last year, it was my moment that he was so happy doing that. He was in front of the lounge, and he had like two big lip cushions, and he was playing kiss and ride.  And he was biking by, had to kiss the cushions before they could go through, and he was doing that for like two hours, and he was the happiest guy on earth.  That was so funny. So that's my best moment, but other family members had the pancake event.  He was baking pancakes for the whole camp.  The Dutch love pancakes, by the way, he didn't know, there are pancake restaurants in Holland.  Yeah, he'd like to go there.  So you guys had to, then all of a sudden he had to leave, he had to go to the hospital in Reno.  I think it was Thursday night that we were dancing for sunrise, and that was his magical moment, and we were biking back to the camp, and he said,  you know what? I think it's gone. I think I really feel that my body is clean. I feel so happy.  So that was Thursday, well Friday morning, and actually Friday night, he became to have pain, and his belly was really implemented.  So that night we went to the medical stuff here, and they examined him and gave him some IV, because it was really hot last summer.  And he couldn't drink like three or four liters a day, because he didn't have a stomach.  So we were there for one night, and all the family members were helping me, and us, and getting to come and get me, because he didn't want to wake me up.  And so I was here, and I had to go there, and then, well, that was Friday night.  Friday to Saturday night, and at the day time he was okay, and the night time he became again very ill, and then Sunday morning they decided that we had to go to Reno to the hospital.  So, well, it was like an emergency, so we got escorted by...  I'll be called a deep...  Deep W and B and B.  Rangers, the Rangers escorted it out.  Yeah, and everybody here just packed my stuff and helped me.  I was walking around in my underwear, not knowing where to start.  So that was really cool, and we were at the hospital in Reno at night time.  And of course I did some x-rays, but you know, when you don't have a stomach and your intestines are clouched together by some...  They didn't know what to make of that, so they were getting contact with our surgeons in Holland.  And I think they knew, but they didn't tell us.  So, we could go back on our normal flight, which was Friday.  Sure.  So, we arrived in Holland like Saturday evening, and then Sunday evening we were in a hospital that did his operation again,  and at Monday they did all the tests, and they came with like four surgeons.  And we were still really positive because he didn't want to believe that he was going to die.  So, they came in with four, and we actually said, well, is this a party because you were a lot of people?  And then they started crying, like for really big surgeons in the hospital, they started crying with four of them.  And they said, well, I don't think we... I don't think you're going to make it because it's back, and we're not going to be able to do anything about it.  And we should explain to our listeners and people who are in the lounge that Arnold chose to end his own life.  Yeah.  Euthanasia is legal in the Netherlands.  It's an option for those who are terminally ill.  And so Arnold chose, as he said, I've chosen to rest.  Yeah.  Remember those are very clearly, and Arnold was able to really plan his own exit from this dimension,  and how he wanted to be remembered.  We are remembering Arnold Roosh, a dear friend and member of the BMI family,  who passed away just this year, actually, I believe.  And we are remembering him in the lounge yet, are you there?  Yes, I am.  So, we're going to listen to an interview next of Arnold.  Do you want to tell people about that?  Yes.  Well, you introduced Hybrid and Redner earlier, and were there really good friends of us.  Actually, I live around the corner of the hospital, and he was operated in, and they came by every day.  Only five minutes, sometimes, just to bring me food, or he had to walk every day.  He has like five or six IV bags, so he had to have a pole to walk with.  And they came to send him lights.  So, he was walking across the hospital corridors with lights, unlike one of those poles to ride with.  He was a burner in the hospital as well.  You can't go without lights.  No, no, no.  So, Hybrid asked because he was on air last year as well, and this year as well.  Arnold, if he would like to tell his story at the radio.  And Arnold is like the most...  Well, I still say is because I don't feel like he's not here.  He is here.  But Arnold is like the most positive guy on earth.  He was even in the year he was sick.  He was making people smile, taking care of me, taking care of the people around him.  And just a sweet loving guy.  And I think the interview will explain that much more than I can do in any word.  So, that's when we were talking about the memory.  I asked you to just broadcast that again because I think he can explain it better himself.  So, let's hear the interview with Arnold Roosh recorded here at BMIR last year.  In the studio with me right now, if you're up to it, I have a...  I'm just gonna pop up in the mic.  It doesn't matter.  There you go.  I have a dear friend of mine.  Arnold was also Dutch.  Yeah.  And his story is...  Yeah, how do you say?  Well, interesting.  Very interesting.  Very special.  Very interesting.  Yeah.  And I just want to share with you guys out there.  Yeah.  It has been an awesome journey the last half year.  Starting off in...  Well, December, basically December 27th.  When they diagnosed me with stomach cancer.  And well, that kind of your world breaks down.  Because they basically say you got about three to eight months to live.  There was not a lot they could do, they said.  So, I went into chemotherapy for about three months.  And in the meantime, I got to speak with some people.  In the meantime, you got married?  I got married, yeah.  Which was awesome.  Yeah, I got married on February 10th, which was on the top of my bucket list.  So, with the most amazing woman that I know.  That's it.  So, yeah, done that.  So, that was great.  Then, that was after my first chemo.  And then I got two more.  And in the meantime, I got to speak with some people in the hospital.  And they said, well, yeah, you're kind of an interesting case.  I can maybe send your file over to some specialists.  And they did.  And I received a call from them.  And they said, well, yeah, we're doing this experimental thing.  And maybe you can talk.  So, I went over there to answer them.  And I was qualified.  And you're still qualified.  Apparently, I'm still qualified.  I'm going to swear on the radio now.  But fuck your ear.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry.  But that's basically the only expression that you can use for this.  They took out my stomach.  I had an 11-hour surgery.  They gave me a very heavy chemotherapy in my stomach area.  And basically, it got better from there.  They will never say I'm healed because they think it will come back.  But I'm here now.  Oh, yeah.  And then, yeah, I have them.  And thanks, I have to give big thanks to my friend here, Hybert.  And Burning Man Edelands, that made it possible for me to be here.  Because we were, of course, way too late for ticket sale.  And they said, well, if you want to go,  we're going to arrange that you can go.  And so did it.  So, big thank you.  This is my third time here in the US.  And I've been to Africa burn once.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  I hope again.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's awesome to be here.  And it's incredible that, if you think about it, there were two options.  Either I would have been probably dead by now.  Or I'm dancing in a desert.  Oh, yeah.  Now, you're dancing in a desert.  I'm dancing in a desert.  Which was an awesome goal to set, day wise.  Yeah.  So, recovery everything.  Yeah.  And my surgery was April 18th.  It was focused.  That's an incredible focus.  And it helped me through the whole thing.  Knowing that my goal was to be here.  And I'm here.  Yeah, I do.  We dance.  We party.  Yeah.  We celebrate your life as well.  Yeah.  Thank you for that.  Because, yeah.  First of all, I was a guy.  And your mindset inspired me as well.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Yeah.  What's your goal?  You can reach it.  Yeah, you can.  You can.  Yeah.  You have to.  We are remembering the life of Arnold Roosh here at BMIR.  Well, it's really special to be here with all the family.  And we're sharing a lot of love and tears.  And I think that's really grateful for that.  And I must say that I'm honored to be a part of this memorial.  So thank you.  Do you want to talk about the next clip that we've got the story  that we're going to hear a recording of Arnold?  Yes.  Well, I told you before that he directed his own funeral.  And he asked one of our dearest friend, Matt O'Sufford.  That's a strange name in English, I know.  But Matt is a really, really, really good storyteller.  He does that all the time in Holland.  And he made that he, at the funeral, he did a really special story  at Arnold.  And I'll tell you later what made that really special.  But I think it's nice to listen to it first.  When we were talking about this memorial, of course,  I can tell the story in my own words.  But because he's such a good speaker, I asked him to record it.  So he did.  And we're going to listen to it.  Well, it's really special.  We will go to that right now.  Yeah.  God.  God.  Hey, God.  There's a strange guy at our gate.  Strange.  Well, he's seen strange before.  Now's this one strange.  Well, he's brought some kind of contraption with him.  A machine or something.  He built himself.  All right, that sounds strange.  Never heard of anyone bringing a machine up here before.  Well, what's he doing with it?  Well, he seems to collect our heavenly star dust,  puts it into the machine.  And at the other end, it prints like it's in three,  the printer or something that prints pieces of rainbow.  Pieces of rainbow.  What's he doing with those?  Well, he hands them out to anyone passing along.  Old people, young people, people died of diseases,  died in concrashes, died of old age,  they'll get a piece of his rainbow.  And then, once they pass through our gate,  they hold those pieces of rainbow.  These people, they look happier and more beautiful  than they ever did while they were alive.  Now, hold on, hold on.  I know.  I know who that man is.  Why don't you tell me before?  There's always one man who can come up with a plan like that.  There's only one man who wants to make people feel at ease  and beautiful and happy.  That man's Arnold Rose.  Now, you go and let us mount him.  We need a man like that in here.  God.  God.  That's Arnold Rose.  That's the man who keeps talking about it.  But God.  He's such a young man.  And that is the story.  Tell us a little bit about that.  Have that happened again?  Well, Arnold, for work, he was a teacher.  You call it college here,  but in Holland, it's called high school.  High school, okay.  And Arnold was running in a maker space  where they had 3D printers and laser cutters  and every student of the school didn't matter,  which I don't know how you call it.  You could do fashion design or you were an IT study.  Every student could come into the maker space  and do his thing with the machines they had.  And the students of the school also helped  the other students.  And that was like his life goal.  He was so happy.  He always said,  even if I didn't pay me,  I want to do this job.  And he was the founder of that maker space  and he was the inspirator of the people who worked there.  And actually, always students like all the stewards,  they were called the students that worked in the maker space.  They were all at the funeral.  And they were like 20 of them.  And they heard the story.  And when they heard that I was going to Burning Man,  they made me pieces of rainbow in the maker space  at the machines they have there.  So the reason I wanted to let this story broadcast on the radio  is first because it's a really special story  and it's really beautiful.  It's beautiful.  But the day of the funeral,  I heard from a lot of people  because I wasn't really looking at the sky.  My head was somewhere else.  But there was a rainbow prior to the funeral.  And it was not a full rainbow.  It was half.  And I heard that from like 20 people.  They came up and drove to the funeral  and they saw half a rainbow.  And then this story came up.  And then the students made me the pieces of rainbow.  So you've got the other half of the rainbow here with you?  Yes.  I do.  And I'm not Arnold,  but I would like to give pieces of rainbow  to like everybody who needs it or who wants it  or who knows somebody who needs it.  Because I think that's how it works.  Absolutely.  You inspire people and you give them pieces of rainbow to shine.  Do we have anyone in the lounge there who knew Arnold  who wants to say a word or two of our memories of Arnold?  And then we're going to play another song.  We're going to do a toast to Arnold's memory.  Yeah.  There's no rush here.  We have all the time in the world here.  I think we have somebody.  Okay.  Well, that's a funny question  because I mean, I can't claim to have known Arnold well.  I met him last year here at BMIR.  Being out is out here like four or five minutes of somebody.  You can feel like four or five hours out there  and four or five hours can feel like four or five days  and weeks and months and years and so on.  Hearing him call his journey and awesome journey  is such a testament to even the way I knew him last year  the relatively limited time we had together  that that was his spirit.  I didn't even know he was ill.  Didn't even know because you know some people wear their trauma  or their disease or their pain or their sorrow  or their difficult emotions like you know  big old black roses on their lapels  so everyone knows it.  And that was just the exact opposite of Arnold.  You know his passion and his compassion is  and his spirit is drive to be here.  But the one thing I really wanted to say  was something he taught me  because I really didn't get to know him  until later in the week, like the last couple days.  Honestly, the last two days maybe that you're here give or take.  We all know the cliché and it's a true cliché  like clichés often are that you know  tell the people you're with, you love them every minute  and spend time with them and get that energy with them  because you don't know how long they're going to be here.  That's true.  But what I think I learned from Arnold  in his very subtle beautiful majestura way was just  you know get to know the people you don't know singer  because you don't know how much you might love them.  Especially out here  and don't really jump on that all the time every day.  That's it.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I think Jack spoke too fast.  So it was a similar situation.  I met you in Arnold last year  and the one thing that was always so inspiring  aside from his amazing powerful beautiful energy  it was always the way that he loved you.  The way he looked at you  and I must have said this to like five people  every time I was like my god  they just love each other so much  and he was just whenever you would walk by  there was a couple of times him  and I were talking and laughing  and you would walk by and the world stopped  and he would just stare at you  and it was just so gorgeous  and then he'd look at me and be like  I love her and it was just  we had a few moments like that  and without us talking just  during the week I always watched for that  because it was just so powerful  and so deep the way that  you two loved each other  and it was inspiring and contagious  and so contagious  that it just any couldn't be  around you two  without feeling that profound love  and that memory is one  that I think I'll always hold on to  just the way he loved you  and the way you loved each other.  Thank you, Jucks.  Thank you.  That's why I can be here.  That's, you know, that's what  that's what keeps me going.  The love I felt and I still feel  and I remember after I was  passed I sent you a little message  on the internet and said hey, you know  I know that this may be  difficult to think about but  if you want to come back to Burning Man  everything will be taken care of for you.  So come and be with us.  We've got a ticket for you  and you'll be here  where you need to be  with your family  and we'll be here for you.  Yeah, and that's what I feel.  I really feel I needed to be here  and while I'm here I'm healing  like every moment I'm healing  thanks to the love.  Thank you.

Oh yeah, of course it's difficult  but I think it's also very important  because he, actually he was really  afraid of dying.  So his dear friend and my dear friend Nadim  he stayed with me  for the last three months actually  after we got back from Burning Man  he came to live with us  and we took care of him together  and a lot of the things we had to do was like  talk to him about dying  because he was really afraid  of dying and of the pain  and of he thought of death  like it wasn't a gateway  or a nice rainbow but he thought  it was like a big black thing  he was going to be in  and every night when the lights go out  and that was for weeks  prior to the decision  we were talking to him for hours  about dying and about his fear  for dying and about  anything that has to do with that  and then finally  he decided to talk to our family  doctor about that  and we said a date  and that's the most  strange thing you  I have ever done in my life  because then you know  when the love of your life  is going to die  and that was like Tuesday  and the date was Saturday  so we had to do a few more days  together which was  like precious every moment of that  every second of that was precious  but we decided  like only Arnold could  that we were going to pass  those days like any other day  because when you  spend those days thinking  that will be your last day  you cannot  right you can't focus on it  no you cannot do that you know  when you go to bed you have to think  tomorrow I'll die you  you'll die at that moment actually  exactly  so it may sound really strange  but we just did groceries  and we just cooked  and we watched stupid Netflix shows  I think  I think it was a rain  it was like a costume series  we finished  together  and then he looked at me and he said  okay this is part  this is like season number three  and that they're going to broadcast season number four  in January I won't see it  it's like god damn it  exactly that he said  so  we chose to  to think of those days  like it was running  we had like thousands of days  to spend together  and actually a few months ago  I just  figured that we didn't even say goodbye  because it didn't feel like saying goodbye  we didn't say the words  goodbye we said  I love you and I'll stay with you  and  he said he wasn't afraid anymore  and that was really a special moment for us  do you want to talk about  I know this may be difficult  and if you don't want to talk about it  that's perfectly okay  do you want to talk about Arnold's decision to rest?  oh yeah  of course it's difficult  but I think it's also very important  because he  actually he was really afraid of dying  so his dear friend  and my dear friend Nadim  he stayed with me for the last three months  actually after we got back  from Burning Man he came to live with us  and we took care of him  together  and a lot of the things we had to do  was talk to him  about dying  because he was really afraid  of dying  and of the pain  he thought of death  it wasn't a gateway or a nice rainbow  but he thought it was like a big black thing  he was going to be in  and every night when the lights go out  and that was for weeks  prior to the decision  we were talking to him for hours  about dying and about his fear  for dying and about  or anything that has to do with that  and then finally  he decided to talk to our family  doctor about that  and we said a date  and that's the most strange thing  you were  I have ever done in my life  because then you know  when the love of your life  is going to die  and that was like Tuesday  and the day was Saturday  so we had to  do a few more days together  which was like precious  every moment of that  every second of that was precious  but we decided  that we could  that we were going to pass those days  like any other day  because when you spend those days  thinking that will be your last day  you will  you cannot  you cannot focus on it  you cannot do that  you know when you go to bed  you have to think tomorrow  I will die  you will die at that moment  exactly  and we just  cooked and we watched stupid Netflix shows  I think it was  rain  it was like a costume series  we finished together  and then he looked at me  and he said okay this is part  this is like season number three  and that they are going to broadcast season number four  in January I won't see it  it's like god damn it  exactly that  exactly that he said  so we chose to  to think of those days  like it was running  we had like thousands of days  to spend together  and actually a few months ago  I just  figured that we didn't even say goodbye  because it didn't feel like saying goodbye  we didn't say the words goodbye  we said I love you  and I will stay with you  and he said he wasn't afraid anymore  and that was really a special moment for us  and I  asked him to be proud  because not only was he  like a beautiful person  but it takes a lot of courage to die  I mean the awe  of his courage  and his brainness  yeah it's really courageous  to decide  you don't want to live anymore  so actually he said  I'm proud  those were his last words  you know that  go ahead I'm sorry  well I  want to share this  that is funeral  and I will share it again  that the moment he passed away  and he went on his journey  because that's the way I would  I like to see it  he went on another journey  he went alone  but it was the most beautiful moment  of my life  because he was at peace  and I think it's the best present  you can ever give everybody  this world in peace  so I'm actually  really proud that I could give him that moment  it's beautiful  let's hear another song  that you had picked out  or that Arnold had picked out  and then we're going to do a toast  to remember our friend Arnold  we remember in the  life of our friend  and dear family member  and can't remember Arnold  passed away last year  yet do you have anything else you want to say  do you want to do a toast to remember Arnold  we have some champagne here at the studio  I believe  or out in the lounge  yeah  but what I really want to say is that  I think I said it  just before the rainbow  or after the rainbow story  I have like a big bag of rainbow pieces here  and of course everybody  in the family can  choose their color  or anything they want  but I have like 200 of them  so I think  I think I can show them with a lot more people  so when you're listening  and you think or you feel  you need a piece of rainbow  or you know somebody who needs a piece  or you just want to take a piece  and hand it over to anyone  you meet as a player  please come and get it  I will leave them here  and here we're going to toast  just one  just one  the next song  that's the last song actually  and that was a really  dear song to Arnold  because he had to surrender  to a lot of things in his life  and finally he had to surrender  to death  and this song really  brought him peace  in the end  so it's a special song  I think we're going to toast here  on his life during this song  and we'll bring you a glass  I will come out  Thank you",

This week, the beloved art installation, Paraluno, was carelessly destroyed.  Also, one of the ice sheep was stolen.  These are works that took their artists months to conceptualize, plan, transport and construct  all for the enjoyment of burning man participants.  Breaking someone's art isn't funny and stealing art is not a prank.  There's nothing fun or playful or clever about destroying an artist's work and property  and it discourages them from continuing to contribute to our city.  If you see something, say something to the people doing it or inform a Black Rock Ranger.  If you can't or won't respect the art, don't come to Black Rock City.",

If they wanted to do something like in that song, you heard like kind of echoing sounds,  you hear the melody and it would be echoed, and they actually would like program the synthesizer  just to repeat every single note, but quieter or something like that to make echoes.

We were getting beer cans and garbage  and costumes and goat heads and chickens  and all kinds of stuff in the porta-potties.  Read the goat head comment.  Do they actually happen?  No, no go ahead.  Okay.  Couches.  I believe that type of animal here.  Tuxedos, I know there was a tuxedo I heard.  They did find a chicken.  A chicken, a half-cooked chicken.  Yesterday, a composting toilet caught fire  when somebody threw their cigarette in it.  Yeah, don't smoke in the porta-potties.  It's just freaking rude.  Well, cigarette butts don't come out of the body,  so they should definitely know.  Our vendors that year quit halfway during the burn.  And our porta-potties weren't serviced anymore.  And we had piles of crap.  Literally piling up in the porta-potties all week long.  It was a disgusting health hazard here at Birdham Man.  And DPW jumped on board.  We almost got shut down that year.  Birdham Man almost didn't happen because of the porta-potties.  And DPW came to the rescue, ran around Birdham Man  with the message of if it doesn't come out of your body,  it doesn't go into the potty.  And we had to find a new vendor that year  to service the potty and Birdham Man was saved.  And the potty project was born that year.  And I hear that there's only so many vendors  that will provide these services to Birdham Man.  Well, we have 1,700 porta-potties here at Birdham Man.  United site services who are the playa gods here in my opinion.  And these are the people and the pumps that come  and make sure you have a clean porta-pottie in the morning.  They are vendor for this event.  And what we want to do with the potty project is to make sure that they're happy  because without them, we cannot have this event.  We appreciate the hard work that they do here for Birdham Man and for this event.  Now, I was not here last year because I had my knee replaced  so I had to take the year off.  But I heard, and maybe you can confirm or deny,  that the thing going around was if you break the porta-pottie,  it will get serviced quicker, and it'll be nicer for you.  Was that actually happening?  I haven't heard that.  I had a triple hernia of lasper and I had to take it off, too.  Okay, got it.  No, but we need to remember that,  because I do feel a lot of complaints in this department about broken locks  and missing toilet lids.  And the one of the things to remember is that porta-potties come here to die.  Burning Man is like the elephant graveyard for porta-potties.  Nothing survives the playa.  And the United Sight Services does a wonderful job of trying to service them.  We have Frankenstein porta-potties that have been hobbled together  from different types of porta-potties just to keep these things living a little bit longer.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  And let me explain the physics of a porta-pottied people.  You're supposed to close the lid on the seat.  Is that correct?  Well, we have that vent up there and that's what I've read, too.  As you close the lid, it helps to vent that wonderful aroma that we get from the porta-potties.  And I will tell you, the porta-potties here are fabulous.  Have you ever been to an English rock concert?  This is like the Ritz Carlton.  It is really bad out there.  They're open pits and they don't react.  Well, again, that's because of the United Sight Services.  Our porta-potties get serviced two to three times a day.  1700 porta-potties.  Now, here's some poo math for you about the extent of their job.  So let's remember that this week when we're out here at Black Rock City,  Black Rock City actually becomes the 10th largest city in the state of Nevada.  Imagine that.  And those porta-potties are our sewage system.  Without a sewage system, you cannot have a functioning city.  We generate over 256 tons of shit and 100 tons of piss are we care at Bernie Mann.  That's a ship pile about the size of 8,747s.  That's the number I was looking for.  Huge amounts.  It only takes a little bit to gum up our systems and to slow things down for our  vendor out here.  So if it doesn't come out of your body, it should not go into the potty.  And that's a simple thing.  But still, people are like, well, is gray water okay?  They're like, is a baby wipe okay or is it a paper towel okay?  No.  No.  Didn't come here, everybody.  Well, gray water is an interesting thing, too, because you kind of think,  well, it's just water.  What does it matter?  Right?  Now, we're talking with, we're already giving you the math.  256 tons, 100 tons of piss.  Now, let's add that.  If every single one of us put one gallon of gray water into the porta-potties,  that's 70,000 gallons of gray water.  If everyone did it, we're all snowflakes.  And I get that.  Now, we can be a snowflake that is positive and have an positive effect on our community  or a negative effect.  And the positive effect with the porta-potties is to remember that  anything that you put to it, put inside of it, has the potential of 70,000 other people  doing the same thing.  And that just generates way, way too much waste to handle for systems to handle it.  Plus, I mean, it's obvious if you start pouring your gray water into the porta-pottie,  it feels up quicker.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And it becomes not useful.  It becomes not useful.  Is it acceptable to like draw our inside of porta-pottie to transform a little bit?  Absolutely.  As a matter of fact, that's a big part of our project is we put signage,  these little reminders about flushable wipes and tampons, not going to the porta-potties.  All 1700 porta-potties have our art in it.  We're technically the largest art project here at the point.  But if I've got some like markers or something, can I bling out?  Absolutely.  I found a porta-pottie over by our camp that's actually a Prince tribute porta-pottie.  Yes, very cozy to use.  Now the only thing that we ask is please do not destroy the porta-potties with your art  while you're creating and loving your potty.  And also make sure that your artwork and the potty does not become moop on the playa  or accidentally gets into the porta-pottie.  Don't go over the inside with glitter.  Don't bring glitter or burning man at all.  Are you aware of the people who used to set up someone going to the porta-pottie?  And while they were in there, they would set up this red carpet.  Oh yeah, when the door would open.  It would be a paparazzi and the day every would be applauding pictures.  I love it.  I love that type of self-expression.  Yes, definitely.  My own self-expression is the porta-pottie preacher.  I go out to the porta-potties every morning with a pulpit and a bullhorn  and reprieach the good word of porta-pottie Jesus  to people while they're doing their morning business out there.  And you took this over for Robbie Dobs.  Robbie Dobs has been doing this since the 2000 burn actually.  And she's still a part of the potty project and she's taken a little break  and hopefully she'll be back next year.  That's working on that to get Robbie Dobs back here out on the playa.  Well fabulous.  Her artwork was the Poo High Koo that's in the Poo Poetry  that has grace the porta-potties for boy.  Even longer than I've been coming to Burning Man.  Well awesome.  Thank you for coming to the studio.  United site services loves being gifted so please gift them.  They kind of swag sticker.  That is what is burning animal.  Yeah but coconut water stickers and he loved it.  Thank you very much.",

Last, but not least, be sure to wash your hands properly back at your camp often, because  hand sanitizers are not effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy, as they often  are after camping for a few days, if you call this camping.  To properly wash your hands, wet them with warm, potable running water, then lather liquid  soap in your hands and scrub them for at least 20 seconds.  Then rinse your hands well under clean running water and dry your hands using paper towels.  Turn off the faucet with the paper towel.  Again, wash hands before you handle food.  Only you can prevent foodborne illnesses and disease transmission.  Stay healthy, wash your hands.  A message from the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health.",
