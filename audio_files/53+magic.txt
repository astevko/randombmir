 What is the most amazing thing you saw?  And I said, those things happen inside,  they said the most magical things,  the most amazing things will happen inside of my head.  When no one else is around,  or maybe one other person is around,  but they may or may not understand the magic of this moment.  And I said, but those things happen over and over and over.  This place is magical.  And I've had atheists who say, you know what?  I don't believe in God, but something's going on out there.  Something's going on here.  Right?
