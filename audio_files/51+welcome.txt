 When your streets are marked by banards, spikes, and your power comes from within.  When children chase the water-trunks that will be air in the air for years.  When your neighbors are naked, and your mind is dressed to the nines.  When it doesn't matter what direction you look in the dark, but there you'll see a glowing portal to a visionary dimension of astonishing inspiration.  Then you know what city you're in.  Welcome home!  Welcome home!
