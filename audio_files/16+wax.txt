 Hey, this is Happy Endings.  And Feather.  And we are Happy Endings Body Waxing.  We're located at 731 between D and E.  Based on our projections,  this is going to be a record year of waxing for us.  And we're desperately in need of a tub or two of hard wax.  So if you have wax, please bring it to us immediately.  We are in the rainbow flower power RV.  Behind the porta potties, and we're there all week from 8 till dusk.  If we're not in, please drop it in our mailbox.  So we can continue offering our body waxing with all of our weird Happy Endings.  Thank you.
