 Destruction of art is not participation and it's not radical self-expression.  It's vandalism and it's not tolerated in Black Rock City, plain and simple.  This week, the beloved art installation, Paraluno, was carelessly destroyed.  Also, one of the ice sheep was stolen.  These are works that took their artists months to conceptualize, plan, transport and construct  all for the enjoyment of burning man participants.  Breaking someone's art isn't funny and stealing art is not a prank.  There's nothing fun or playful or clever about destroying an artist's work and property  and it discourages them from continuing to contribute to our city.  If you see something, say something to the people doing it or inform a Black Rock Ranger.  If you can't or won't respect the art, don't come to Black Rock City.
