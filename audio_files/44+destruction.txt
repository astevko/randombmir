 So, uh, we've got an important message here, um, um, this is really sad that we actually  haven't even talked about it, but, uh, there you go. So, destruction of art is not participation,  and it's not radical self-expression. It's vandalism, and it's not tolerated in Black Rock City,  plain and simple. This week, the beloved art installation, Paraluna, was carelessly destroyed.  Also, one of the ice sheep was stolen. These are works that took the artist months to conceptualize  plan, transport, and construct all for the enjoyment of Burning Man participants. Breaking someone's  art isn't funny, and stealing art is not a prank. There's nothing playful or clever about  destroying an artist's work and property, and it discourages them from continuing to contribute  to our city again. If you see something, say something to the people doing it or inform a Black Rock  Ranger, and if you can't or want respect the art, then don't come to Black Rock City.
