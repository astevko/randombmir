 But since that first temple we built as a community back then, it adopted this, the temple  adopted this really, really deep meaning to so many burners and it's very, very beautifully  done.  Yeah.  No, and that's very much it, is that this, it's interesting because the notion of grief  of sorrow is not alien to Burning Man at all, that on the contrary, Burning Man incorporates  the entirety of the human experience, whatever whatever your feeling has a place here, that  is one of the things that distinguishes it from so many, from so many festivals, from  so many theme parks, which all of which are saying, you know, we're trying to get you to  feel this way.  Burning Man, whatever you feel coming in, whatever you feel going through it, is what you  are feeling and what we work with at that point, and this thing was, I know that I  am guaranteed at least two major existential crises every week of Burning Man and that's  not because something is going wrong, that's because that's the process that I'm going  through.  So yeah, even, I mean, the entire human experience has always been part of this from the  very beginning, and grief has been particularly reified that way in the form of the temples.
