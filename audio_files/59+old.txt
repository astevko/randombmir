 I'm from Bristol, Rhode Island. This is my virgin burn and I'm 68 years old. So my story is about  the fear of being too old. I called my doctor before I came. Just to get a little bit of advice,  should I bring anything special, should I do anything special when I'm out here on the plie. And she  said to me, you're going to burning man, you're not 28, you know, you're 68. In fact I'm horrified  that you would make such a decision. And it shook me up for a few minutes and she said, well, I guess  you've made your plans already. And she's usually a very cool doctor. But we hung up. And for a  moment, I thought, am I too old to go to burning man, but I'm here. I'm in the time of my life.  I slid down a slide and fell on kind of on my face and everyone around me picked me up and said,  I did that too. And that was a perfect 10. And so I'm loving burning man. And my lesson for the real  world is you are as young or old as you want to be and never give up doing it.  Come by B-M-I-R between noon and four to record an entry in our diary.
