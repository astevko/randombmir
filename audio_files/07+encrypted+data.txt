 Encrypted data is a playful and visual riddle.  It is meant to be a fun and surprising beacon for open-ended interactions, as well as a  treasure hunt game.  The main purpose of this piece is to encourage private and deep, thoughtful communication  between friends and strangers.  The installation is a 12-foot key made of wood, glass, LEDs, and an electronic device.  The key stands on the playa, and the central hole hosts a small electronic device that  allows people to write, encrypt, and print out text.  The lighting changes based on the use of the electronic device.  When someone is typing text, encrypting, or printing, how do you feel about having your  actions sitting across the playa by this device?  What do we do to keep our privacy?  Our actions are up to us, but we must acknowledge the behavior of the devices we use.
