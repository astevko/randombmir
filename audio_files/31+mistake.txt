 You've already made a huge mistake coming to Burning Man.  Might as well make a bigger one.  Come haul your dusty butt to Pussy Avalanche at  Dewey and 4.15 at 9.30 a.m. Friday.  We've got events all week, but Friday is extreme.  Join us at 9.30 ish for naked volleyball.  Prizes, awards, possible humiliation.  We have it all. Not feeling athletic? No worries.  At the same time our resident body painter at Pussy Avalanche  will be working in our paint check, helping transform you into a cat.  Only do organic stuff? No worries, her mana.  Our team of extreme henna artists are waiting in the mislounge.  Park yourself down on our lounge chairs,  and let our team of talented artists and random alcoholics  pursue you with designs from their favourite nightmares.  Pussy Avalanche 9.30 a.m. Friday.  Dewey and 4.15.
