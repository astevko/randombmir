 and wrote a story about him and I as laborers in in the union up at at and up in the ice house turn up going up towards Lake Tahoe  there's a sidebar to all of this while Larry was living with me up in a placerville and he had quit the job on day one  because he couldn't physically do this he just wasn't about to do anything like that  he he said at my house and unbeknownst to me he went to the library and of course he he loved the library and he was a vivacious reader he did it he read constantly  so about a year later after he'd left England back down to the city a police arrived at my door and he when he came to the door he said to me  um you owe the library uh three hundred and fifty dollars I said for what and he said for two books that you went through and they're very expensive books and uh  you've got to go and I said well what are they and he said one of them uh one of them is well he didn't know he didn't know he just said his his is the bill and you've got to pay it  so I went into the library but the time I was doing construction so I went in with the two biggest animals you've ever seen  one of them was mock bonds and it was another guy and they just where he's huge guys with no necks  and I walked in there and the two books that they accused me of not returning one was um uh  understanding Freud and the other one was uh Joseph Conrad's uh Nostroma Nostroma  and I went in and I said to the lady at the at the counter of the library I said excuse me uh  but I've got this ticket for three hundred fifty dollars because I didn't return two of your most uh popular uh  one of your most expensive books and she's that's right you know  and I said well now look at us look at these two guys I'm with  does it look like they read something about like understanding Freud or Nostromo  and she said well I don't know I said no seriously ask them  they wouldn't even know what the hell I'm talking about okay and she said well  is your name Michael Hopkins I said yes it is and she said do you live at uh  three-twenty-one has it street and and plastic bill I said yes I do  and I she said well then you owe three and fifty dollars I said that's impossible I mean seriously  I mean I for one thing I can't stand Freud he's a shoe salesman and these guys have never  met Nostromo in their lives they wouldn't even know who Joseph Conrad is  and she goes well obviously you took the books as I said wait a minute  what's my social security number and she read it up and I said wrong it's not me  at that point I said to myself who would be taking out books like that  why that's Larry Harvey because he was living with me  and he actually believed in Freud which I always told him  was just a shoe salesman the guy anyway that's philosophy and I want to get into it  so I said well that's not my social security government  so they dropped it and they said well whoever it was so later on I called up Larry and I said Larry  what's one of your favorite books he said oh it's got to be Joseph Conrad Nostromo I said aha  yes well as a matter of fact I just got nailed for three hundred and fifty dollars  because you stole that book from the public library
