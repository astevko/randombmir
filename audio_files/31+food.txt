 Hey Bernie Mann, this is Shacken from DPW. I'm here to talk to you about  collectivists. The collectivist stations are on the way out of town near the  Greeders. We collect non-perishable goods and other fire-useful items such as  whiskey, beer, and bacon, among other things. These items are used to help the crew  that stay to clean up the event as well as donated to the Girlack Senior Center,  Girlack School, and the locals. If you have anything you can donate that would  be useful on the playa, please pack it at the top of your car for easy access.  On the way out of town at our station, we also offer a window with. We also offer  window washing and license plate cleaning for a safe travel home. Thank you so much  for all your donations. They fuel this event and make so many people happy. Making  hope, wishes and dreams come true for 2018 and beyond.
