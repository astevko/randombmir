 Alright, we have Clara Cooper online. This is my mother mother. It is nice to hear your voice. We're on the radio of Burning Man. We're talking about ice cream.  You're talking about ice cream.  We are.  Is that why you phone me?  Yes, but ice cream wasn't euphemism for group sex.  So that was...  The euphemism for group sex? Did I hear correctly?  That was exactly what your son said.  Yes, it is good for me.  Or maybe that's why I have an ice cream every single day.  You go, man.  You go, man.  That is a fun one.  Mom, I'm glad you took the call. I just want to say we didn't always get along.  In the last couple of years we have, I love you very much.  I think you said I love you too very much, but I've always loved you very much.
