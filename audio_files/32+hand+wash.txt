 Handwashing is the first line of defense against the spread of many illnesses, including  foodborne illnesses.  So please, be sure to wash your hands before you handle food.  And remember to use the hand sanitizer provided at the Porta Potty Banks after using these  facilities as well.  I mean, that's a no-brainer, right?  Last, but not least, be sure to wash your hands properly back at your camp often, because  hand sanitizers are not effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy, as they often  are after camping for a few days, if you call this camping.  To properly wash your hands, wet them with warm, potable running water, then lather liquid  soap in your hands and scrub them for at least 20 seconds.  Then rinse your hands well under clean running water and dry your hands using paper towels.  Turn off the faucet with the paper towel.  Again, wash hands before you handle food.  Only you can prevent foodborne illnesses and disease transmission.  Stay healthy, wash your hands.  A message from the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health.
