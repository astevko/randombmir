 The MIR 94.5.  Oh, we get it.  When you're ready to rejoin the default world,  the last thing you want to be doing  is sitting in line during Exodus.  Here are some pro tips for making the best of this  of your Exodus.  The best times to leave are early in the morning and late at night.  The longest waits are the few hours after the manburne  and the temple burn.  The gate team calculates wait times  from the former Greeder station  to the entrance to County Road 34.  If you're just departing your camp  or encounter a backup before getting to Greeders  or there's an accident down the road,  please know, your wait could be longer.  Gate Road pulsing will also extend wait time.  Pulsing allows the gate team to get the maximum amount of cars  on the County Road 34 without causing backups  in Girlock and Empire.  If you're on Gate Road during pulsing,  turn off your engine and get comfortable.  Get out of your car, walk around,  meet your temporary neighbors, drink water,  take a nap, use the potty,  you get the idea.  Lastly, have an Exodus plan.  Use a well-rested, designated driver  for the first leg of Exodus  and to get you all the way home.  Getting out of Black Oxyde can be exhausting  and difficult after all your play experiences.  We all want you to make it home in one piece  and come back next year.  Please drive safe.  Please don't die.
