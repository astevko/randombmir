 There are a million tales in Black Rock City.  Let's make sure yours is one of the good ones.  First, take water with you wherever you go.  Travel with a friend. Use the buddy system.  If you don't know what's in something, it's probably best not to eat, drink, or have sex with it.  If you feel like you've been toast, get help immediately.  If you see someone who appears to be under the influence, check in on them.  And if you start to feel unwell, quickly tell your buddy what alcohol or drugs you've taken.  Seek medical or law enforcement help. They can both help you in a medical crisis.  Burning men abides by all local state and federal laws.  You should too. And remember, we're a community.  We need to watch out for each other.
