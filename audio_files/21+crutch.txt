 We need crutches. There are a lot of ankle foot and leg injuries every year on the  playa and nearly everyone requires crutches. We know a lot of you probably have a  pair of crutches lying around that you no longer need. Be a manch and throw those  on the to bring pile this year. Will you? You can drop them off at any of the six  medical stations all over the playa. They're marked by a red cross on the map. You'll  get from the greeters. You'll be giving a fellow burner a much appreciated leg up.
