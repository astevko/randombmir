 Zeyeps Lundin, the opposite of me.  We think they know how to do it.  I have some Paulo.  We think they know how to do it.  I had you hockey.  To the bone?  That sounds amazing.  Yeah, that's the 89 FM rock and roll radio.  And some Paulo in Brazil.  And...  It's a better Maccaldo.  Yeah.  That's about all I know.  Yeah.  So, I worked a long time there.  And in 99, 99, I was sent to...  Which stock?  99?  To cover it.  There's a media coverage.  Really?  Yeah.  And in the last day, when Red Hot was playing and all the fire went up, all the hell, and...  I heard about that.  Yeah.  Instead of doing my journalists or doing my real business that I was supposed to be there,  I just ran out.  As you said.  I had some listeners, some fans from the radio station that they were with me during the trip.  So, I decided to protect them and set off doing the coverage.  And so, then, that was the end for me.  That was your first burning man, maybe.  So, my first burning man was Woodstock 99.  Yeah.  Serendipity for you.  I was at the actual...  The first Woodstock.  I was in the first Woodstock.  Six years old.  You were there?  I was six years old, yeah.  Yeah.  I was in this one, which was 99.  Which is a complete total fucking disaster.  Yeah.  My first one was really cool.  If I could have remembered most of it, but it was six, you know, coming.
