 Let's check in with Mark out in the Inner Circle mark. Did you have a favorite mark?  Yeah, hey, I'm with a very lively trout. Got live music going.  Yeah, so can you still hear me okay though? We can hear you even over the music.  Okay, well, I like to come with things. I like the rainbow bridge.  One of my friends did the electrical engineering on that and I got to play the keyboard.  And controlled the lights on the bridge. And also liked an installation out in deep ply about one o'clock.  Trash fence. Sort of like a sound installation.  Eight speakers around in a circle.  Played out on a couch and just listened to all these really interesting sounds coming out directions.  I think I can pass it back to you for now because it is very loud over here on the play a piano bar.  And we are almost to the end of the perimeter at this moment.  Great, thank you Mark. It is a little out back there. There must be a good party going on on that art car.
