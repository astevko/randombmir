 I have a message from your creator would you like to hear this message? I don't think I have a choice at this point. Okay, your creator wants me to let you know that ever since you were the smartest  berms selling your daddy's ball sack you've been doing everything perfect. You are a winner. Everybody that hit the egg sale is a winner. The losers are spit out swallow shot on somebody's ass or  kids. Come on. We're all winners. There's no competition between any of us. Love each other. Love yourself. You cannot love someone unless you love yourself. You have to love yourself. A good in the bad. It's all, all you and you are all of it. That was, that was something.
