 Things that should be obvious like leave no trace and moop patrol. Remember moop patrol doesn't happen when you pack up  I mean it does happen when you pack up. Remember not just your moop, but your neighbors moop to we are all in this together  We all keep black cruxity alive by taking care of the environment and of each other  So when you're mooping at the end of the event  Look your neighbors camps to help them out a little bit  But more importantly take care of moop as you go. Don't let anything fly free  Besides your spirits and your souls of course here in black rock city  But you know patrol as you go and take care of everything that you can take care of  Because it's up to us to keep the city alive. It's up to us to keep this  Ridiculous and I mean that in the best possible sense the word dream alive  Important us to keep the inspiration the creativity and the  Petri dish of experimentation here alive  So we can not only enjoy it here every year, but we can take what we glean and take it out to the outside world and make things  better there
