 Hold. Have you checked in with yourself lately?  Hold stands for hungry, angry, lonely and tired.  Each one of these four emotional and physical conditions,  if not cared for, can leave you vulnerable.  So, we invite you to hold for a minute and check in with yourself.  Ask yourself, what am I feeling right now?  Am I hungry, angry, lonely, tired?  How do I feel about my mother?  Actually, you can forget the last one.  Don't underestimate how powerful the simple act of checking in  and listening to yourself can be.  Listen to your body's signals.  Then fix it and you'll be good to go again.  If you want to keep going, you should think, hold.
