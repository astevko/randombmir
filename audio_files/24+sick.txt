 You don't want to get sick on the player, right? Right, so make sure to cook your food  to the proper temperature, wash your hands before preparing or eating food, and observe  all health department protocols when serving food to the public. You did get your health  permit, right? Finally, don't drink the non-putable water that comes out of the water trucks.  Let's all avoid food born ill in the system. After all, this is burning, man. Not a bad thing, man.
