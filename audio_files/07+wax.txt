 So we have a wax situation.  This is an emergency.  It's urgent.  We have a wax emergency, you guys.  So, you guys are doing waxes.  Now, I've actually now, you know, like TMI, right?  I've never been a waxed.  I don't know.  I guess I'm a little curious, but also kind of not.  But, you're doing like chest and, like,  merkin areas.  And, like, are you doing anuses?  Again, I have done a few anuses today.  It's probably in previous year.  No, not today.  Not yet.  But, we try to do generally based on our wax, like, smaller patches.  So, so you have the smaller,  smaller, anal patches of the waxes.  As long as you have a small anus.  Okay.  Right.  You guys have a screening process for the...  I have what I have.  A huge asshole.  Oh.  Yeah, no.  Okay.  Yeah, that's...  So, there's no screening process.  More so just the length of your hair.  Okay.  Yes.

You guys need...  Yes.  Yes.
