 A polar bear stands in the desert by Don Canal, an Arctic-burned 505.  The relationship that humans have with animals is profound.  Animals figure prominently in human evolution.  Yet in the modern world, animals can become invisible, and humans may easily forget the  necessity of our relationship to them.  By creating monumental sculptures, the artist hopes to make animals visible and to bring  particular species into human consciousness.  In polar bear, recycled carhoods become flexible slabs of steel.  These are bolted to a steel frame that defines the surface of the 34-foot polar bear.  The polar bear has come to witness the burning desert.  She has a message for the humans, taking the long view is crucial to our survival.  How far into the future are we willing to consider the impact of our actions?  The long view allows us to accept responsibility for the actions we take today, actions that  will have impact decades or centuries into the future.
