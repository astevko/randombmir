 Got gas?  Yeah, me too.  Jenny doesn't run on unicorn farts.  Look, if you're bringing extra fuel,  storing it safely is your number one job.  And it's a serious responsibility.  Here are the basics.  One, fuel expands with heat.  Never fill your fuel containers past 80%.  Store your fuel in the shade if you can,  but never in a confined space under or near a structure.  Or near an ignition source.  Keep a fire extinguisher easily accessible and visible  within 10 feet of your fuel storage.  We recommend a 40B rating 5 pound extinguisher.  Three, no more than 255 gallon fuel drums,  or no more than 110 gallons of fuel total,  can be stored in a camp.  Four, keep your fuel storage area at least 10 feet from heat sources,  such as burn barrels, grills, stoves, running gennies,  RVs, tents, trailers, camp structures, and public areas.  Never store fuel inside or under a living area.  Five, if your neighboring campus storing fuel,  keep your stores at least 100 feet apart.  Six, all containers, no matter the size,  have to be stored in secondary containment basins,  in case the fuel container fails.  The containment has to be capable of holding 110%  the volume of the largest container stored within it.
