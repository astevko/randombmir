 The Family Unification Network, or Fun, is a way to make sure your family burns together and returns together.  In instances of a lost child or separation, Fun helps to reunite children with parents faster.  Here's how it works.  Parents and children register together at Ranger Headquarters and Center Camp.  After providing simple identifying information, children will receive a unique wristband with a serial number,  which will identify the child, parent or guardian, and camp location.  That's it, simple.  Registration is open daily at Ranger Headquarters, before noon and after 2 p.m.  Should your child become separated from you, they just need to find a ranger,  and the wristband will facilitate a speedy reunion.  And what does that spell?  Fun!  Remember parents, burning man is a lot better when you remember to have fun.  That's right.  You're listening to 94.5 BMIR.
