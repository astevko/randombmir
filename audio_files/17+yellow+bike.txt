 Do you know what a yellow bike is?  What's a yellow bike?  This is a community bicycle built by DPW, very hard workers.  We spend months building these yellow bikes that are free for you to ride.  There's a free rule about the yellow bikes, ride it, and then leave it in an obvious place  for the next rider.  Decorating, locking, or hoarding this bike is theft.  Don't do it.  If it's broken, fix it, or flip it upside down so the crew can identify it.  Again, these are free bikes built for the community for you to use at your leisure.  If you break any of these rules, be ready to get heckled hard.  We can be really mean.  Don't mess around with DPW.
