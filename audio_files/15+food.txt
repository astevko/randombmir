 Dan, that was a great night at Robot Heart.  Dave, it feels like the Thunderdome's my head today.  Well, here's a fresh cup of coffee to shake out those cobwebs.  Nah, coffee won't.  Damn, Dave, where'd you get coffee this good?  This early.  Dan, I got it right here on the playa.  You've got to be pulling my leg.  It's true.  At the Sunrise Diner on the 3 o'clock G Plaza.  Open 9 to noon.  A diner, huh? Do they have food?  They've got made to order breakfast sandwiches.  You can get them vegetarian, dairy-free, even without gluten.  Here we are, Dan, Sunrise Diner, 3 o'clock G Plaza.  Look at that line.  I'm glad we got it here early.  They're here for the fresh coffee, delicious sandwiches, hot off the grill,  and some shame to enjoy the night.  Ooh, that's a good sandwich.  3 o'clock G is the place to be.  You got that right, Dan.  3 o'clock G is the place to be.  3 o'clock G is the place to be.
