 Let's say, you know, it's a friend's birthday,  it's a graduation, mother's day.  How do I pick the perfect dildo as a gift?  I know for you, color is a big color.  Color is important, not essential, but I do like a sparkle.  The D that I have with me at the moment is not sparkly.  It is purple.  It is quite realistic in a lot of ways, but purple,  which is, I think, just a great color for a dildo.  It's very royal, it's very powerful.  I mean, for a dildo or really for anything,  I've got purple in my hair right now.  I like to rock a purple lipstick from time to time.  I enjoy the color purple.  You know, also the film is great, if you will.  But, yeah, I mean, criteria, it really depends on.  I like to think it depends on what you like,  what's great about being a lesbian and being interested  in a dildo is that you really get to pick whatever you and  or your partner is interested in.
