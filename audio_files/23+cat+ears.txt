 So I have just come from the beautiful, fantastic strap-on-a-thon at Camp Beaverton at 715 and E.  Magic is still happening there. I had to tear myself away. So if you're listening right now and you  are a female identified individual who likes other female identified individuals, you should head  that way. All are welcome. All are beautiful. I had a fantastic time. I met a woman from Australia  who... It's the accent that sells you. The accent is great. It's not my first time with an  Australian, but what I will say is it is my first time with a woman who made cat ears and a cat tail  out of her own cat's hair. Oh, that's that's really creative, right? It's the positive way  that I'm going to phrase that. And I'll just say this. This wonderful Australian, she told me that  her ears and her tail were made out of her own cat's hair. Cat's name is Bella. She said,  this is Bella and stroked her own cat ears. And then she showed us a picture of Bella,  the white Persian just screaming in the picture. And I said, do you want a fuck?  And I can't... I'm not supposed to really maybe say them in the radio, but that's what I said.  I won't say it again. Well, that's good. We're off to then a wonderful, wonderful start. Wonderful.  Wonderful start. Any other events that you want to really plug right here at the beginning? We'll  continue to do this throughout the show, but things that sound just amazing to attend.  Things that sound amazing to attend. You know, I am so in the moment that I don't even know what else is  happening.
