 Boo, boo, burn, broken bone, bachelorism, what do all these have in common?  Well, besides starting with the letter B, they all suck when they happen to you.  Luckily, there are now more medical stations than ever before to help you out.  Just like always, there'll be medical stations at the 3 and 9 o'clock plazas and at 5.15  in Esplanade.  But now there are new stations at the 4.30 and 7.30 plazas and between the temple and the man.  Stay safe out there.
