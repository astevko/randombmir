 There you go, two bloody marries.  Hey, thanks.  Hi, I'll have a dark at the stormy.  You'll have a what now?  How about a bad habit?  How about no?  You got her booth?  I'll have a bartiti.  Sorry, kid.  I have ice cold lemonade.  Why can't I have a bartiti?  We don't serve alcohol to you if you're under 21.  Oh, it makes you sick, I'm under 21.  You like six?  I'm six and a half.  I'll take the lemonade.  Come in right up.  Don't serve under age.  If you're in doubt, check ID.  And if you look young, carry ID.  94.5 BMIR
