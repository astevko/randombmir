 So we like to play music that maybe you haven't heard and what we like to play here, it doesn't have to be a band you haven't heard  I mean, that's kind of hard to do, but we want to play things a little bit outside the norm. We are here to escape for a bit the real world  To get recharged and inspired for our journeys back to the real world. And yes, I very consciously am using the phrase the real world people  Because it's not the default world. I get where that came from. I get why it quote unquote makes sense  But that is the real world out there. And as far as I'm concerned, our quote unquote jobs here in Black Rock City  Uh, our job is to get engaged with each other inspired by each other  Converse with each other get creative with each other and take what we learn here and what we glean here and what we experience here  And apply it to trying to transform the real world in a way  That is analogous to the way the Black Rock desert gets transformed into this wonderful thing here  Which I consider like the eighth man-made wonder of the world one time magazine a number of years ago  Is trying to do a poll to figure out what those wonders should be I firmly believe and so believe Black Rock City  Should be one of them because if you brought anyone out here who didn't know it was going on and showed them this and said hey  It's here for a week and then it goes away without a trace  They might not believe you and they'd be kind of very rational not to believe you  So we are here to get engaged and get inspired and experience new things and so that was a very long way my name should be too much
