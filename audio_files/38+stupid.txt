 And people come to Black Rock City, and they think, wow, it's another world, it's another planet, another universe, because it's so, what is?  It's mysterious. It looks like nothing else you'll ever experience in this incarnation.  You're like, not just traveling, I don't know, intercontinental, you're traveling intergalactically out here.  So therefore, you get out here, and you think maybe that laws don't apply, but they do people, because we're in Black Rock City,  but we're in the state of Nevada, and we're in the country of the United States of America, and laws do apply here.  So be smart. There's only one kind of mantra I have here, one quote-unquote rule to suggest to people, which is don't be stupid.  And one really stupid thing you can do is to make law enforcement do their jobs.  If you're stupid with some of the things that you just heard sung about with a lovely diddy, yeah, they have to do their jobs.  That's their job. Your job is not to be stupid, alright?  We've got a lot of BLM friends here that have been here for years, a lot of our sheriffs have been here for years, who enjoy being at this event,  to enjoy the beautiful sights and sounds of Black Rock City, but not the beautiful smells like you smoking a joint, alright?  Don't do those things. Don't be stupid. You have a great burn, that all of our friends and law enforcement have a great burn,  because law enforcement isn't the problem. If you're being stupid, the problem is you, alright?  It just applies. A lot of new people may be coming in for the weekend or gotten in yesterday. Just be smart, be safe, safe, be creative, don't be dumb.
