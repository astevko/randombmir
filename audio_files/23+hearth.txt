 Listen by Aaron Desmond, stop, listen to your heart, listen to the hearts of others.  Find an opening in your heart, allow someone else to enter it, if there is room, make  room, allow yourself to be surprised, allow yourself to be transformed and bring compassion  to all the hearts you let in.  See everyone reflected inside a single heart.  Listen is an installation 10 feet tall by 20 feet long, an eclectic mix of you speakers,  fastened together, acting as building blocks around a frame in the shape of a human heart.  The heart admits beating sounds through the speakers, intermittent and layered.  Inside the heart, thousands of broken mirror pieces come together to form a mosaic covering  the walls, reflecting light, color and bodies.  Allow you to reflect on what it's like to be joined with so many hearts to hear and  feel them on your own.  Inside you will find digital stethoscopes.  Touch a stethoscope to your heart.  What happens?
