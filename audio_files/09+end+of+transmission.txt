 I should clearly not be got the air.  Intervention.  This is an intervention.  We're signing off BMIR.  It's an intervention.  You've spent too much time on BMIR.  We got to just, we got to get you off.  We got to tear this thing apart.  And rehab.  We love you Bob.  I need ten more minutes.  I've got some stuff lined up.  So...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I've got...  No, no, no, I've got...  I've got to...  I'm trying to throw it to you  and knowing it's picking up the...  Oh, we're right here.  We're all right here.  We're all right here.  And we...  And we all love you  and we all want to tear the station apart.  That's fine, I need...  No, I need ten minutes.  Jesus Christ.  No one has left me alone in the studio all fricking night.  I've been trying to do a show and say goodbye  and people have been...  It's hard to be loved so much, isn't it?  It's very hard to be loved so much.  I don't want to be rude to say,  get the fuck out of the goddamn studio.  Right.  But I need ten minutes.  It was.  So talk.  What I figured was...  No, no, no, no, no.  Yeah.  The man wants to go.  I've got to cue something up.  What are you from out of town?  I know, everybody knows.  So, uh...  Which we don't love about.  We're under, we're under now.  Wax on.  Wax off.  I took care of that earlier this week.  It was great.  It was very nice.  So...  It's not that hard.  Everybody pass the mic and say,  what you wanna say to Bob?  Here we go.  Nate, what do you got?  The Gateway Times are currently under an hour.  This is literally the best game I've ever had.  The best game I've ever had.  I guess we owe it to Bob Zella.  I love you, man.  This is no Nate.  Last time I'm on the mic.  Indeed.  Yes, yes.  You're fired, by the way.  Yeah.  This is Venus.  And I'm gonna be introducing the best news show on BMIR,  the app of Power Hour.  It's an alternative radio station.  Yeah, next year, whatever.  Yeah, on your favorite station.  And I wouldn't be here without Bob Zella,  and my boyfriend, the Trojan horse.  Trojan horse.  Indeed.  So...  I wouldn't be here without Bob either.  11 years ago Bob said,  I want to go on radio.  He's like, done.  And I did it.  So thank you, Bob.  I'm like, you're fired.  You're fired.  I didn't even add that.  I wouldn't be here at all.  I've got everything set up.  Bob, shut up.  Shut up, Bob.  I'm gonna fade down, Bob's mic.  Bob, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.  I wouldn't be doing radio if it wasn't for you.  Bob, we love you.  I love you.  I appreciate all that you've done for me and the station.  I've appreciated everything you've done for the station  and all that you've done for us.  Much love.  And happy trails.  Big fucking...  It's a cuddle puddle here.  Hey, this is Indiana Jones.  And I would be here with that Bob Zella either.  Thanks so much.  Because it made me...  Oh, stop it.  You're embarrassing me.  Let's put it on your under.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Don't, don't, wait, don't.  Yes.  It's gonna be fine.  Don't give way though.  Give way to the end of the show.  Ladies and gentlemen, live from Black Rock City.  Bob Zella.  All right.  It's...  Oh, shut the fuck up with you, mate.  Back in 1927, I had a little farm and I called it heaven.  Prices up and rain come down and I hold my crops all in the town.  I got the money.  Bought clothes and groceries.  Fed the kids.  Took it easy.  The rain it quit and the wind got high.  The black old dust storms filled the sky.  And I'll swap my farm for a Ford machine.  And I filled it full of this gas.  I lean and start it.  Rollin' in it.  Twistin' the California.  Way up yonder on a mountain road.  I had a hot motor and a heavy load.  As it goin' pretty fast.  I wasn't even stoppin' eyes about to nothin' down.  Like popcorn, a puffin' had to break down.  Sort of a nervous bust down of the...  mechanism there as I'm kinda in giant trouble.  His way up yonder on a mountain road.  I wasn't feeling so very good.  And I give this rollin' for to shove.  And I was a gon' coast as far as it could.  I'm instant rolling.  Takin' up speed and there was a hairpin' turn.  And I couldn't make it.  Land alive and I'm a tellin' you.  The fiddles and the guitars really flew.  That Ford took off like a flying squirrel.  And it flew halfway around the world.  It scared our wives and childrens.  All outside of that now.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  This dusty old dust is a blowin' me home.  I've got to be rolling along.  I'll sing this song, but I'll sing it again.  On the place that I lived on the West Texas plain.  In the city of Panther, the county of Greed.  Here's what all of the people are sayin'  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  This dusty old dust is a blowin' me home.  I've got to be drifting along.  Anyway, like I told you, the old dust storm hit there.  These people all congregated in their little houses.  And in the room in the house that I was in,  there was 12 or 15 people.  And the power was there.  Telling each other so long it's been good to know you.  Dusty old dust is a blowin' me home.  And I ain't got long to stay.  I've got to be drifting along.  Well, here's what happened.  The telephone rang and it jumped off the wall.  That was the preacher paying his call.  He said, look at the shape that the world is in.  I've got to cut price on salvation and sin.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  Dusty old dust is a blowin' me home.  And I ain't got to be drifting along.  The church houses were jammed and packed.  People were sent from front to the back.  It was a dusty.  The preacher couldn't read his text.  So he folded his specs and it took up collections.  And so long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  So long it's been good to know you.  This dusty old dust is a blowin' me home.  And I ain't got to be drifting along.  There is still time to become a member of this radio station.  Is this thing on?  Can you hear me now?  There we go.  There's this thing on.  And as we come to the close, I'm on a rock-ass deal.  This is my farewell transmission.  Signing off, Mr. and Mrs. America, all ships at sea.  Someone within the sound of my voice.  I've got 50,000 watts of power.  I rise the air.  This microphone turns sound into electricity.  Can you hear me now?  Out on Group 128 with dark and lonely.  I've got my radio on.  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Welcome to my top 10.  I'd like to thank our sponsor.  But we haven't got a sponsor.  Not if you were the last man on earth.  She was prepared to prove it.  This one goes out to a special girl.  There is no special girl.  It's the...  It's in the radio.  The last announcer plays the last record.  The last what?  It leads the transmitter.  It circles the globe, the search of a listener.  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Is it really broadcasting if there's no one there to receive?  It's the radio.  As we come to the close on broadcasting.  Got my radio.  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Music  Music  Music  Music  Music  Music  This is a test, if this had been a real emergency, hey, hey, this is a real goddamn emergency!  Ciao!  I was well, for a long time, watching the sun rise.  And the salvation of your voice,  and the salvation of your voice,  and the very good of you,  without knowing that you are worshiping  Yorando, yorando, yorando no es fácil de entender, que al verte otra vez, yo  estoy llorando, yo que pensé que te yo le di, pero es verdad, es la verdad, que te quiero  aún más, mucho más que ayer, dime tu que puedo hacer, no me quieres dir, y siempre estaré  llorando por tu amor, llorando por tu amor, tu amor se llevo todo mi corazón y quedo  yorando yorando yorando yorando, yorando yorando
