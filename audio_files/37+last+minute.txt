 It's a long, long road to Black Rock City, and it can get a lot longer right at the end.  When traffic backs up around Gerlock, you may be tired, impatient, excited, or all three,  but you've traveled hundreds or even thousands of miles to get here.  Don't screw it up in the last five.  During peak travel times, we'll be controlling traffic with highway flaggers along 447.  Watch out for signs and flaggers on the road.  They're here to make your trips safer.  And gas up before you hit 447.  You'll avoid the long lines and hazards of trying to fill up in Gerlock.  As you approach the Burning Man entrance from the highway, tune your radio to 95.1FM  for GARS, Gate Advisory Radio Station.  We'll be broadcasting up-to-date info about the entry process.  Not sure why there's a backup or how to get to Will call, tune in.  And please, drive no more than 5-10 miles per hour on the gate road, speeding causes dust,  which makes it hard to see our volunteers on the road.  It also creates ruts, which makes it hard on your suspension.  It also makes you look like a jackass.
