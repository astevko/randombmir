 Black Rock City, Dawn, a yoga class.  And as we move from Ustrasana, camel pose, back into Chakrava Kassana, the cow pose,  our friend the sun is just peeking over the mountains in the east.  Hello, son.  It's a beautiful morning, isn't it?  Hello, son.  And finally, we're going to...  What the hell?  Hey, are we in time for the yoga class?  I'm sorry, can you turn down your throbbing trance music?  Do you guys have like extra mats?  There's like, uh, 30 of us?  Can you turn that down?  I mean, it's horrible.  You're ruining the vibe and no one can hear in your music sucks.  What?  Your music sucks.  Thanks, I know it rocks.  I'll turn it out for you.  Hey people, let's talk Sonic Sanity.  Here are a few simple rules to help ensure everyone within earshot doesn't hate you.  One, the city is zoned for loud and quiet areas.  Know your neighborhood.  Two, use common sense and consideration when driving a mutant vehicle up on a new spot.  Art work, a camp, a gathering, a wedding, whatever.  Three, don't blow out your neighbor's 24-7.  Work with them and agree on a plan.  This message was brought to you by ears.  Ears, they're everything you've heard.  And more.
