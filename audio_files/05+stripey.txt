 We're from Camp Cromania. We want to invite all those people out there that have stripy pants  that would be black and white rainbow colored and we want to invite them to come join a parade. Wednesday, 6 p.m. at the man  Stripy pants parade  So what if you don't have stripy pants? Can you still participate? Tell your friends that do have stripy pants to join  Have a parade. Can you steal your friends? Stripy pants? Please do. But that would leave them shirt cocking maybe.  I think there's no real rule against that is there? Well, there's no rule. Yeah, so it's fine.
