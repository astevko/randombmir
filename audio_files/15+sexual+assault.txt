 Hey, I want to talk to you for a minute about something very serious, sexual assault and  what you can do to help prevent it.  BlackRock City is an urban environment and sexual assaults can happen here like in any other  city, but we can stop it.  First, respect people's boundaries, no means no.  Watch out for your friends, be aware of your surroundings and trust your instincts, and  if you see something, please say something.  Let's look out for each other out there, and if you feel threatened, immediately yell,  help, I need a ranger or fire.  If we work together, we can prevent sexual assault in BlackRock City.
