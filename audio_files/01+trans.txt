 visible we are the less the less we're in hiding really it's it's a double  in short is that is that the more people learn about what trench gender is the  harder it is for us to pass well that's true that's true the other thing is  though is that as people get to know us and our community we are at less of a  risk of violence yeah because you do know us and you do know that we're just  fired right I mean the thing is it's you know there's always let's let's  throw in some other terminology the trap syndrome where you know you think you're  you're it's always it's always a guy and it's always a transgender woman who are  the traps and and the reason they're called traps is because the cis-gendered  guy feels that they were they were trapped and fooled and it's like I didn't know  you were trans and then gets violent and this is how transgendered people get  murdered yeah and that's because people are living in stealth mode this is  all another reason why I'm very very vocal and adamant about like I want more  visibility and yeah does that help you color oh yeah that absolutely makes sense  I appreciate the discussion in the back and forth on that and I appreciate you  tuning in from Clare down in hot land to my my nieces down there I love I'd love  that area awesome yeah all right so thank you so much and we'll  will wait for another car you're listening to BMI R the voice on your  FM dial oh there's a dial there you go boom there you go there you go there must  be a button David get in here for Mike one of you two oh this is for for eight five  eight BMI R eight four four eight five eight two six four seven let me do that  my girl voice ready that's pretty good copy of my R eight four four eight five  eight two six four seven that's like your phone sex worker voice I actually like  that should be your radio voice I like that I'm not gonna lie when I needed many  early in transition I did internet sex oh yeah wow well you got to pay for that  somehow you know no shame in that game yeah color you're we got a color you're on  the air hello hi who are you I am Amanda Amanda where are you calling us from I'm  from Dayton Ohio Dayton Ohio oh my goodness another Ohio in do you know how my  friend from up there she's one of my internet romances she's a gorgeous girl so  what's your question I was wondering whenever you go through the gender reassignment do you  lose sensation or do you do they cheat those nerves active in order for you to  enjoy sexual pleasure or that kind of different oh honey tight jeans in a  ride in my Jeep I could never have a orgasm driving in my Jeep as a guy tight  jeans in a Jeep I'm off to the races crazy wow and get this fantastic multiple and  two years ago this we last here rocked my world and I learned a thing that most  trans women I did I as a dude I never knew this existed after shocks she rocked my  world so hard a half an hour after we were done and cuddling I had another orgasm oh well you  want to super right now I actually picked a bad surgeon in Thailand I picked  Dr. Peachette oh he butchered the hell out of me I went to Marcy Bowers and she butchered me  again oh she's she was horrible so then anyway I found a plastic surgeon actually my friend  the one who transitioned at 15 she found a plastic surgeon in Salt Lake who fixed  everything but my nerve endings super girl I can have I can have  literal and vaginal orgasm wow okay that is amazing yeah that's absolutely that's  a classic but here's the thing that that experience is not universal there are I mean depending  on your surgeon just depending on how how your body takes to it you know you'll  hear stories is you know as successful as this one and then you'll also hear stories of  like yeah I don't really feel anything down there anymore but that's okay because in my head  I feel right you know it's really some of the surgeons are getting really progressive like in my  case so part of the tip of the penis where all of the super nerve endings are now mind you it's not  a sensitive as as a woman born with a vulva because of vagina has something like  our clitoris has twice the nerve endings that a penis does so we're taking the tip of the  penis and part of it was forms the clit and the other part some surgeons put up in to imitate  the sensitivity of the cervix and so that's why there's so much sensitivity up in the vagina that's  really interesting actually I have a wonderful close friend of mine who transitioned and went through  the surgery and unfortunately she rejected part of the inverted skin so damn yeah you know as  someone who has wanted to do the complete transition it was obviously very heartbreaking but the cool  thing about what she did was she was very open with it and shared it with her friends on on social  media yeah and and remove some of that that mystification of oh my god yeah what happens and shared  that and I you know I thought that was amazingly brave of her yeah I mean I love that the people  are taught I mean 20 years ago when I first started this process of you know figuring out like you  know transgender stuff there wasn't a lot of information out there was really like like the hardcore  information like nobody told me ever like I did not see this anywhere that when you start taking  female hormones you might just pee uncontrollably without like you you're and might just leak out of  your penis without you having any control over it wow and I'm like how is this not written anywhere is  this like this like dirty little secret that all the trans people don't want to talk about speaking of  this get this so let me talk talk to something else about this are you still there Amanda yeah so here's  the other interesting thing interesting factoid is is that that our vagina does not self lubricate  there are some new techniques they're using for sub lubrication I use actually a vaginal cream that  has estriol and estrogen in it and it helps me lubricate but when I'm actually being intimate if I  have an orgasm they have left the coppers gland and the prostate because those secret fluids that were  part of the seminal fluid part of the semen and so if I have an orgasm that fluid will leak into my  vaginal canal and then I I have lubrication huh that is so cool wow it's really it's amazing what  they can do a technology so I have to have looped a star but when I'm having sex if I have an orgasm  then I am having lubrication wow wow wow this was way more than you bargained for this this is exactly  perfect so I actually have a question and this one am I still on yeah you're all right so I heard  that they you know there are different surgeons that can do this procedure and you pick the one  that you like best because they have a specific technique so now my question is how is the technique  different I kind of thought you know just like this one thing you explained with the banana but  what different techniques are there can you say something about that well that's that it's a tough  one and in fact one of my friends back home just went to a surgeon in Austin I've never heard of  and did labia majora and labia manora at the same time we've had we've had to have I had two surgeries  and my labia manora is almost nonexistent I don't know if you look that close no but I can look  would you like to look here let's look again so if you look the labia manora that's pretty they're  really cute and dainty yeah that's pretty small pretty so this is one thing I was mad about when  I got home from Thailand I had this really nice plump clad and doctor powers cut like three  fourths of it out because she said real women don't have large clads listen as a former body  piercer and having seen I don't have more than your share yeah more than my bear share of people's  bottom bits I have seen you know very large cladrs is the size of my thumb and it's right and  and just to go on like this is going to be a weird little shift away from tranny but those women  are embarrassed a lot of times of their clad and and I've always encouraged like oh my god no you  are lucky to have that oh absolutely don't ever be ashamed of what you've got oral sex with a  large clad is awesome um so back to your question so here we go so back to the question it's it's  so there's it's called the um penile inversion technique is the one with the whole banana peel thing  I talked about there's some other techniques like you can do a a portion of your colon which gives you  more depth and the colon also self lubricates oh yeah the dilemma is a sometimes that comes with  an unpleasant odor the new technique is a take a part of the stomach lining it's it's I mean  it's cutting edge I'm talking about in the last 12 months they're they can take a portion of the  stomach lining and it self lubricates and it's still I would say still in the trial and error phase  because we don't have any longevity wow wow but the one but my friend who went to Austin  and I don't know officially what she calls that but but she said that her labia menora are as beautiful  and pronounced as her labia menora and the other thing for us because of the way the different  bodies are are labia menora which are the big leps for those of you who don't know these nice scientific  terms the labia menora usually look like deflated inner tubes so my plastic surgeon and salt lake  actually sucked fat out of my stomach and injected it into my labia and about 40 to 60% of it sluffs  off in the rest day so I had multiple procedures to get the labia the way they are wow  yeah I am so impressed well and I have to say it's it's really if you're if you're  MTF male to female your options for surgery is bottom surgery is so much better than FTM unfortunately  the female the female to male get all of the masculineizing passing we get the good bottom surgery  yeah yeah yeah well I think it's a lot easier to remove tissue than to have tissue I think  yeah really what it comes down yeah yeah there's an old really nasty saying what used to say  wait what is that I want to say well you take a hole then it is to build a pole wait it's easier to  take a hole then build a pole and what that means is that you can't we there is no way they tried  with with chicken tissue to try to learn how to try to make self-growing lit spongiosum so that people  could have a natural erection but they can't do that so female to male has a metoidal plastic which  is basically just using the enlarge the clitoris gets enlarged yes testosterone yes which ends up being  like it's a small penis or a nice way yeah and then they run a urethra up and then they expand the  labia put some prosthetic testicles in right and you're in small penis and then um  phalloplasty is taking a part of the forearm or a part of the thigh right creating a phallus  sewing it on and then putting a pump inside the dilemma is is again the tissue rejection  it has a pretty high risk right right and I'm assuming then if it's you know a form from something  that's not as sensitive as someone's actual genitals then sensitivity probably and again since women  start out with twice as many nerve endings in their clitoris right as the penis then you know  guys will default to staying with metoidal plastic because they have all the sensitivity right so  does that help Amanda that is so educational that was a lot so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna  clear the line and see if we can get another color is that okay Amanda absolutely have a great day  thank you for sharing thanks for tuning in and thank you for burning from afar yes  all right the line's clear so if somebody else wants to call in we'll do you have to play some PSAs  not yet night turns out oh yeah okay yeah because we build on the last group we'll just play  oh kinesle do you kinesle kinesle do you have a you have a question do you have a question to ask a  tranny kinesle uh uh uh uh not really it's like not really you just love this kinesle knows this and loves  us and has known us forever and I have one but let's leave some up here yeah um so oh there's a  here we go isn't that cool here we go actually yeah how do my nails look you know I was jealous of  your nails two nights ago so I had to go and do my own wait color are you there color are you there  oh hello hello who are we talking to this is harry nuts harry nuts where you call that is not your  name is it right now I'm not on play I'm in redondo beach redondo beach is in the house what do  it what do you have to ask a tranny today yeah I have a question on voice how does that fall over the  hole voice yeah your voice oh god it's such a struggle I'm gonna sound like girls can I take this one  you can hold that so here's the deal if you are female to male you're in luck okay you don't  your bottom surgery is not gonna be as good as you know as as a giant as yeah exactly they can make  a vagina better than make a penis but the good news is is when you start taking testosterone your  voice drops um and voices so it's such a it's it's I mean we're talking about passing so testosterone  makes the vocal cords lengthen and thicken it's why when you think of a piano string yeah the thinner  piano strings are high pitched and as the testosterone thickens the vocal cords the pitch drops  which is why when you're going through puberty you're getting you know jolts of testosterone to your body  and your voice changes if you're born male and you know your voice changes as you get older so when  you um if you're born female but you start taking testosterone you basically go through puberty  and your voice drops however if you're born male and you start taking estrogen well too bad your  vocal cords already thickened the estrogen will give you will soften your skin it will give you  breasts it will do all sorts of things but it will do anything for your voice so yeah you have  to do vocal training and vocal coaching and we have lexie with us and lexie and and notice we all  have different voices because some of us are more spot on with our if we're on our game color  so I actually did some theater I did some some I worked in the film industry a little bit so I  was able to have access to some pretty good coaching so if I'm really on and I really want to make  sure you think I'm a cisgender woman I'm going to talk really feminine and up and down and sing  songy I mean there sadly there is some truth to that um like you would think I mean I feel like  most at least maybe like a lot of feminists would think that's like really absurd right like  what why is that the indicator but it's it's a number of factors like it's just like with passing  in general there's a num this like it's like additive right it's like it's like one thing could  not knock you off the horse and it totally changes somebody's view but it's but in general it's like  it's like what's the facial hair looking like blah blah blah blah and and it's the same with voice  there's there's there's a pitch thing there's a placement thing and then there's like the speech  patterns like you're saying right and and it does make a difference and I mean I I don't think I'm  I really like uh put on ears when I speak but but it does make a difference and it's really like  it I mean it's a fence it if it offends my it offends me that that that makes such a difference  it makes me really angry and I think the three of us you have the most struggle naturally feminine voice  well I I have a lot going for me I was a professional singer I went to a grad school for singing  and so I already had a mind like attention to it and then I spent a lot of time with voice therapy  with Christie Block in New York City so so yeah I mean I mean it made it made all the difference  it made all the difference I thought I thought color what do you mean the color does that help you  the color yes yes color I want to know that there was training involved to other than just the  testosterone estrogen that part of the diodenal there's any surgical thing they did on the voice  box there are there are some surgical techniques where they stretch the cords and staple them down  they've had some real bad side effects from that so I don't encourage it yeah there's um there's  a new a newer technique that uses lasers from South Korea right and there's been a higher success  rate with that but still not like not not fantastic and the lasers kind of burn off part of the vocal  chord so they have thinner vocal chords that was my question so they actually make the chords thinner  I see it's like it's like strings on a guitar the fat ones are obviously your bass and you get down  right yeah but there's still there's still limitations um anyway like they're you're not um change  you can't really change the carriage and that works that works for I mean that that works against  trans men as well like you'll get a thickening in the vocal chords but it's depending on my age like  the right and and you'll get you'll get a develop like a Adam's apple kind of development but you  will you won't like the larger cage won't like it's grow because the bad start from a certain age  in just in general your bones fuse and you don't hear bones don't grow right and those of us in the  community trans men's voice kind of gives them the way because they all kind of have some voice  sometimes but yeah I mean they'd say there's nothing consistent but there are some things that pop  up again and again part of the reason why I'm open and and do this education is because I want to  demystify and so when you see us and we're different we're just different we're just less common we're  not less than we're simply less common absolutely okay so I'm gonna clear the line and I'm gonna play  some promos that caller thank you so much for calling him from a door to beach I forgot you thank you so much  thank you very much right call in very great to participate off fly a love you thank America and I hope  to be out there and next year and be able to thank you and both rest the community thank you there you  go next year was better anyway right but earlier there was talk about being born male and then  transitioning being born female and that's terminology like as a new school or whatever whatever  that uh that I strongly object to like I I mean everybody's got a different conception of themselves  and if you think you were born male and then whatever but not everyone can see it themselves that way  and I think it is I mean I don't think it's like a flight of fancy to for me to say that I was born female  and and I was a birth defect yeah I mean I there was normally no no I mean that's a common way of  of of of justifying yet but I don't think I need to justify it you know word you don't know anybody  adjustification so are you you're you're basically you don't like the term born yeah this is why  you probably a sign male assigned like a well also in in terminology um a mab or a fab which is  assigned yeah we were we were we were man who transitioned a women or we were right but in the new  the new vernacular it's it's assigned male at birth yes what did your birth certificate say and  doesn't match who you are but there's like lots of reasons for that because uh uh uh you get  in this whole argument of whether not only is is gender a construct which I that's the one I that's  the one I object to I think I think gender is very very real I don't think it's invented but but then  you get to the point is is is what's biological sex and I think biological sex is the I'm not the first  person to say this but I think biological sex is the construct do you have this wide spectrum of how  people are born and we're just like obsessed with with a physical polar ideals of what a man and  a woman are but there's so many so many people are born not matching that ideal either like a genetically  or physically are for so many different reasons speaking of which I have a great massive aversion to  the gender reveal party the gender what oh the gender reveal where were you hit a balloon and it's  pink duster blue baby is he meaner for two people yeah I really really bugs me every time I see  that I'm like I hope your kid grows up to be transgender yeah I inspired my I host karaoke at home in  New York and I inspired my bar I mean my bartenders is open-minded lovely human being John but um  he just had a second baby and for both of the kids like you know we've been working together for 11  years and so he's been he was through me you know at my side through everything and um he uh he  named both of his kids um clever and in and and compelling but gender neutral names um uh robin and  ember to see you know the cuz just because like if they just you know let them have the freedom of  doing whatever they want to oh we have another collar take for calling collar you're on the line  with ask a tranny at bm IR with whom do we have the pleasure  are you there color are you there hello oh color oh oh try again color how about that oh there we go I  had to move a dial that was a that was a peb cac care okay who are you hi this year pal Henry  from Salt Lake City oh my god Henry what's up we need you here bro yeah you need a chance  masculine presence in that yes yes we do we do I'm doing my best but you know can I say no we need  every perspective in here we have we have we have we have uh three well we have two chance we've  been in here and and uh did you say I identify I'm pretty much trans I'm non-binary trans feminine  right but we need every perspective in here and I'm so glad I'm so glad to be up to play alone on  on I got a cell box here I'm so glad you called because we do absolutely need a chance masculine uh  presence and a non-binary presence because it's like people it's it's part of what keeps all  of us all of us down is this like fetishization of trans women and and and and uh looking down upon  a femininity it like screws everybody up and so like people need to know that trans men exist in our  presence and like I don't know I feel very strongly about it so please go on and actually me want to  speak yes not just not just strong and silent and and and for you listeners Henry Henry brought me  to Burning Man five years ago oh wow oh wow he's like the most you're welcome everyone yeah he's the  most kind of gentle um man you'll ever know and and so Henry thank you again for for getting me out  here to the ply and getting me connected via my arm so now we're all gonna shut up and give you  just yeah Henry I want to hear what you have to say well I'm just on my way to work and I just  had to pull over for a second because of what was just being said about this binary construct of  biological sex um it really it just spurred me to call in because I wanted to say something about it  because I work as a primary care physician and I do a lot of work with people with hormone not  for transition just for balancing for them to feel like themselves with their hormones going  crazy for whatever reason and I do see so much variation in these levels of hormones that fall  outside of what we're taught in medical school that you know here's the normal range of testosterone  for a female and if you go outside of that you'll have all these horrible side effects and you have to  do something to suppress it and it's just I have this other perspective on it and I just encourage  people like it doesn't you know you can be female and have a testosterone level naturally of 75  which would be way outside the normal range but it's not normal for you it's fine exactly those  norms are are invented by people that's why that's the whole argument behind the biological sex is  a construction of of humans and and we it's imperative that we come to a world where that's okay  we're having that with being female and having that testosterone count is okay it's imperative for all  of us to move forward and it's about balance and it's about getting people to feel their best and  there's no set normal there's no this thing is not there is no normal it's quote unquote white  there's common I love you guys and yeah thank you my call and we wish you were here yeah we do  we we wish you were in the studio we need to we need your advice and I know you don't want to come back  but next year come back oh he hits warned to me he's never coming back I've heard that before  we'll have to make a not offering can't refuse love offering you're on the line with BMI are ask a  tranny oh my god I am so excited and who are you babe can I call you babe without offending you I'm sorry  I am calling from Sacramento California sacked out in the house totally I love the donut place  no marie's donuts and it's like it's killer because when you go to prep sorry to talk  love look at the radio yeah well because when you prep when you win someone yeah outside of Sacramento okay  that are transitioning male female and one is a beautiful woman the other one is struggling  and in my untrained eye and you know so one is what we call passing I don't know so well I know  she get um called out a lot called out in my way and and struggles with this transition whereas the  other one seems to be just flourishing yeah well I don't know how to help so so this this is the  unfortunate part of our community I have I have a different out here in the play that that we clashed  the first couple of years partially because I was a douche but but but what was they it's a long  story for not for this show okay anyway last year we connected in a different way we've been  Facebooking and they because they go by the gender neutral pronouns they called me out one time  and said you know it's all right because you're beautiful and you pass I will never pass so I have  to live in the gender um what the gender danger zone if you will because I will never pass and that's  a reality that I hope with my education that we quit shaming people for not looking girl enough  or looking boy enough or or WTF ever you know you bring up a very valid point and I have friends  back home that also will never pass well however it doesn't change the fact that they feel like they  feel well I agree with all that but what what was your question actually you laid out the situation  what was the question I don't know I'm phobic I feel I feel bad I said that I I mean I don't I see  this I don't want to see this you know like you don't want to see color right yeah right well I don't  think there's anyone who's like earnestly trying to wrap their heads around this I don't think  anyone should feel bad because if if the if the world I mean if if the world were in a different  position we wouldn't need to be asking these questions like if we were not in the ideal world yeah  that's the whole process this is why we're on the radio yeah especially with the political  world we have in Trump Estonia but community right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well I mean my  my I don't my recommendation for that is like we can't prioritize people who pass but but you  got to have you got to kind of reconsider your friend as just like any other woman who's who's  having strong who's having struggles it's like I know I really I used to equate passing  issues with like a disfigurement and in other kinds of disabilities I definitely try not to do that  anymore I think it's offensive to both parties but but if you can conceive of it somewhere in that  realm of like the the the two women are essentially in the same oh actually all three of you are  essentially in the in standing on the same ground and you're dealing with different interfaces with  the world and that's the kind of that's the kind of you kind of have to equate those things to have  the right compassion like this is your fellow you know fellow woman walking the world and she will have  some of the same struggles that you do and and and some different struggles and and and you also have  to kind of like try to imagine how how how frustrated and and how much it would drive you mad to be  face I can't even imagine and struggle let me interject something that may help you and she's also  anonymous and they would not allow her in an all-feeling meeting all the time in the lesbian world too  yeah it's challenging I'm that was that was huge and let me let me give you let me give you an  example of how this affects all of us not just trans women my neighbor across the street I'm five  foot 13 my neighbor across the street is also five foot 13 she's she was assigned female at birth  my neighbor is is is was assigned female she's having a female she's she's happy being a heterosexual  woman her partner her husband is amazing guy she gets misgendered all the time because she's tall  and big and looks masculine yeah and and we became really good friends and neighbors when I moved  into that neighborhood and then one day she comes up because can we go to coffee we got a copy my child  just came out as transgender and I don't know what to do so here we are these three women in this  neighborhood two of us are transgender and one is cisgender yet we all get misgendered wow yeah so  it's it's not just a struggle of of transgender one at my job I worked for the state of Utah at one  time in in the human services department and a woman in the cubicle next to me was almost bald  on the top of her head and she's also female she just had alopecia right and she would get misgendered  so when when we when we when we do transphobic things when we when we call call out if you will  transgender people because somehow we think that they're less than and we get to do that we're also  harming women in general or harming the divine feminine and in so doing we're also harming the  divine masculine yeah we're harming everybody when that when the when the bathroom bill started coming  around in North Carolina and all this so then she started proposing them there was a huge increase  in cis women trying you know people trying to deny access the bathroom to cis women and and because  you don't look girl enough to be in our girls bathroom right right right phone lines are open btw  you keep that thought like eight for four eight five eight two six one seven or two six four four six  oh I was seeing it from my angle it's BMI are eight four four eight five eight BMI are and in our two six four six  four six boys eight four four eight five lines are open  okay I see I saw Kinnisla out there I saw um I mean Becky Joe has oh here we go  and excuse but people outside need to come in and ask those questions color you're on the air with  that's good dranny hello hi hi hi I'm Colleen from North Carolina um speaking of you guys to  return to the thought of how misgendering people can damage the divine female and the divine masculine  or sacred or however you want to use that language I have some of my life who is resistant to  using the appropriate gender for people and it's been a discussion ongoing for years with him  and this is a new angle on it that I think he might actually hear and might resonate with him um and  I'd like to hear more of anyone's thoughts who'd like to contribute well so in in my spiritual practice  I grew up in a very um very binary uh very Christian Mormon family uh I was exchange student in  in Mexico and lived with very much a a devout Catholic family my my in-laws are Mexican my ex-in-laws  are Mexican so I very much understand the the Christian dynamic I studied history and world  religion so I understand the Abrahamic religion dynamic thank you so much my doll we just got  some buttons and I'm in love so so I have left I have left the Judeo Christian Islam Abrahamic  thought and I live in more of a an eclectic spiritual world in which my basis is the Native American  medicine will and the four agreements of the Toltec philosophy so I I participate in different  ceremonies and swat lodges and and it's interesting the swatlage ceremony is a renewal and the  swatlage is considered the womb of mother earth and we go into the womb of mother earth and do a  life cycle yet almost all the lodges are controlled by men and it's another way that men are controlling  femininity and it hurts my heart so I started out being the super angry feminist being mad at my  previous male self who was a very much patriarchal misogynist prick and and I became this angry  feminist lesbian and then I was in this ceremony and and it came to me and in my mantra my spiritual  teaching when I lead a swat lodge or when I lead a retreat is that this world is not going to heal  until we embrace the divine feminine now in some worlds in some communities in some spiritual  circles that means that we get rid of patriarchy and bring in matriarchy again and and I propose to you  that matriarchy and patriarchy are both systems of one in control of the other so we divine we embrace  the divine feminine and at the same time we embrace the divine masculine misogyny is not the divine  masculine and and being controlling angry women is not the divine feminine we come together and the  divine feminine divine masculine embrace and simply become the divine and we quit living in this  binary world of boys and girls and whatever well we need to do that anyway I mean that's the  construct is I mean again if if if we're misgendering somebody because again we don't see them as  simply less common we see them as less than right if he misgenders someone to me that says more  about him I agree I mean if people people compensate no I mean even in your example of your own life  like someone will someone will might try to attack swinging from like this you know misogynist  kind of person to to to self identified radical feminist to finding somewhere in the middle as like  as like fake or wishy washy but it's just you people people I mean everyone has their struggle  and and and trans people have struggles and people compensate I mean it's same with all the politicians  who come you know get outed like people have people overcompensate to try to make sense to their  worlds and and and I have compassion for that not not disdain I have I have yeah I'm and I have  I like to add to the to the divine feminine kind of conversation and answer it in a very like  unspiritual way I have a spiritual practice and I'm actually I'm a full-time DJ but I'm a professional  terror reader and astrologer as well and and but I did nevertheless I'd like to answer this in a very  like mundane kind of way absolutely um nobody wants to be reduced to their parts no woman  wants to be I mean maybe maybe not but you know I can at least say I think I think it's it's  many women don't don't want to be reduced to to you know to being a sex object yeah  subject and no one wants to be defined by their body parts people want to be appreciated for  being a human being and whatnot and I yeah I think I think the concepts of masculinity and femininity  while you know while I think they're they're they're they're more vaguely defined and more fluid than  we allow them to I mean I think they're things that it exists and obviously the people care about  and and I think we should make a special effort to redefine them not based on body parts for everyone  saying I mean it's a classic example but I have a friend you know I have a friend in this position  if if you're a cis woman and you uh don't you either lost or don't have the ability to conceive  that does not make you a less of a woman true and as this and as you know you just extend that  argument to to to the trans experience I think it's I think it's I think it's simple  these are secretly struggles and I'm trying to help him shift with uh people who  identify as non-binary with day-appropriate yeah I think tell him I love him and I invite him to see  the world in a different way I mean we're all in this together too like trans people don't get  a perfect either trans trans people I mean binary trans people often have to have trouble wrapping  the minds around non-binary experience and you know there's a lot of what they call internalized  trans misogyny so like you know like trans women or I mean trans people general but I speaking from  experience trans women can be really really harsh on themselves or other trans women or other women  in general for for certain standards and uh it's all it's all rough and it's it's it's it's we're all just  like trying desperately to to to not topple the jenga tower and try to try to make sense of our world  so I mean I you know it's just it's complicated I think I think I think one of the biggest takeaways  about the discussion it just the the broader discussion is that it's not simple you do you do you  do everybody has a different conception of gender everybody thinks that most other people share their  conception of gender even though everybody has wildly different or you know gradation you know different  and uh and uh and it's not you can't boil it down to one thing like everybody's got a piece of the  puzzle it's not you can't boil everybody try think many people try to boil gender down to to one  principle or one mechanism or a couple mechanisms and like oh it's all about that and it's not it's  about all of it some you know some of it is is behavioral some of it is biological and it's just  big hodgepodge that that we as you know um in our multitudes and uh you know in our in our in our  great variation of humanity we're we're just trying to make we're just trying to you know like like  with everything we're trying to group it in ways that make sense so we can process our world and  we just have to massage those groupings and and and we evaluate those groupings does that help  yeah thank you for your first sentence oh thank you for calling in too I learned a lot so I'm so glad  hey that's you know that that makes my heart just sing and and I'm so glad you're turning into  BMIR out there in the default in and um I'm glad we get to bring this piece of home to your home  to your other home so I ran out I'm sorry Collar okay so we're gonna just we're gonna work it  off the lines again thank you for calling in hey yeah so I ran out the the lounge because uh  Becky our campmate who of course injured herself pretty bad today can not now walk into the studio um  we love Becky we love you so much we're sorry you're stuck out there um anyway she wanted to get back  to just the word tranny for a moment and she wanted to make a comment and and kind of thank you  for using the word because you know as uh she thinks that what you're doing today and using it is  normalizing the word and making it less mysterious less of an epithet if it happens um and she also had  a question about it and that was after the show now when someone comes over to the camp they're they  are gonna find you and camp and go dumb oh you did the tranny show are you gonna be okay with being  that tranny and I know the answer to this wow uh and and and no you don't because no I'm not oh wow  no I'm actually surprised so say more about this so and here's the reason why yeah it goes back to  what we talked about at the top of the show yeah um Adrian and I own that term and we get to because  we've earned that yes guessing right with 20 plus years of absolute bullshit pardon me  I really think that the easiest way to break this down in terms that everyone understands is  tranny is the t-word as the n-word is to the African-American community we get to say it  you don't yeah in that sense I love that I think it I think it I mean I I want I would like to  suggest that it's not a direct parallel but are there are some very strong similarities yeah  and and I would concur with that yeah because because because the t-word has  20 years of bad history and the n-word has century but some of the similarities include uh uh you  know the word being reclaimed and being used in various various different contexts by various  different people and like that I don't know if people are aware but there's this whole um controversy  for a hot second with um RuPaul oh yeah because in the in the drag community and in the the  the gay male community uh and like cross-dressers and uh so forth um they they used it uh amongst  themselves uh as a as a term of a deerman and um whereas people like us it's used against us as  violence and and I think both of those usage are valid I mean they both have a history and  and I you know I value and honor the experience that those people have in those in those scenes  but we're in a different world now and if we're if we're in it together I mean it's the issue of  intersectionality if we're in it together we yeah we gotta we gotta agree to stop stop doing that we  gotta we have to agree that it's that it's that it's that it's that it's that it's because it's a  word used in violence that we we need to move away from it but is it really though I've never like I've  gotten I've gotten yelled at I've gotten scared yeah but it's always we talked about this earlier  where I was like like training was never a an epithet it was I mean it was it it was always a  term of a deerman I never heard that someone yell yell you know no one no one yelled from a passing  car hey traini and I have I have I mean there's there's various levels here like we live in we live  in a bubble and like you live in a very liberal bubble so that's one thing and nevertheless I mean  I I haven't been yelled at no one's yelled traini at me in San Francisco but but someone yelled  back at me you know yeah now that I've gotten to yeah I've gotten faggot right I've gotten freak I've  gotten all these words yeah but never training yeah it's like I think the I think we here's the  thing about ask a trend we're gonna bring shwaggy out from New York so stand by shwaggy here's the other  thing you can ask you can ask a hundred transgender people a question and you're gonna get a hundred  definitely any should and you say so shwaggy thanks for joining us on the show what what what can  we help with mate hi I just wanted to say first I hope everyone's having a great burn we are thank you  I'm sorry I can't be there with you on flyer I'm doing couch burn for New York City  haven't been to the fly in a while but I'm watching live stream on YouTube and listening to show  so I feel like I'm with you uh with my heart and maybe some of my old camping buddies that  cost you call for listening to uh the broadcast so I had a costume called hi this I'm uh this is  uh ill-exandered from New York I play for costume called you mate you have seen me you gotta go see you gotta  go see my question uh what you know everything is changing so quickly with this kind of I don't even  know what to describe it just you know you guys just dynamic or that it's it's very dynamic it's  different than when you were younger and so how is someone he I don't even know the right terms to  use I'm sorry I identify as a gay male I don't know I really don't know much about it I'm trying  to understand it better but how do we you know how does someone who's not does not identify this way  you know how can we educate ourselves and try and stay current and sensitive to you know what's  happening yeah I mean you're doing it right now first of all you're engaging in the dialogue and asking  they're asking yeah you know everywhere I know I know I'm trying to think of all the things I've  done in the last two decades plus um I was at a Western state's conference and the director of the  New York gay and lesbian communication it was out and and she was a cis lesbian who who did a lot of  trans inclusion so look I would say look first to your pride center and if they don't have  transforming then ask them to bring it in yeah um find people like uh Alexandra to to have her do some  education yeah we can get coffee when I'm back in Brooklyn there you go and and and I and I um the  Google the YouTube I mean there are so many trans channels on YouTube now that you can watch so many  cool stuff yeah I mean I'm not a young guy but it's really interesting my my niece is a lot  younger you know in high school and she's got friends who are trans and one of her friends in particular  you know identifies as I'm not even sure you know trans are non-binary or not I think non-binary  yeah non-binary is definitely giving it's sometimes she wants to be called a she sometimes she  wants to be called a day and this is fluid and changing yeah so you know I just I always ask my  niece if I ever see her friend what am I supposed to well you can I I as a non-binary  binary person can say when in doubt you will never go wrong with they yeah um yeah and it's and all  of us I I have not found one transgender person who is offended by which pronouns do you prefer  yeah I do I am the exception at rule I think I think logically it makes perfect sense that you  should ask someone who's what their what their pronouns are but it shakes me it messes up my whole  day when someone asks me that if they like that that that that they that they that they did it even  crosses their mind that's the dysphoria speaking I get it yeah I mean it's mostly on me but I  can't I'm driving nuts so is that so how do you prefer I I point people to to assume that I am female  and you use right so and not have to ask me so this comes down to you are feeling you're a woman  yes you see yourself as a woman yes and so I can understand how it's distracting toward to your day  and turns you down because it hurts the passing thing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's internalized  transfobia right right absolutely yeah and I have it as well I if somebody if somebody misgenders me  it hurts deeply because I'm like and here's what I've learned though and and a friend of mine taught me  this they were in a grocery store and somebody called her sir and she's just like she walked out and  she she said I got my grocery cart or the room I was so angry and she said wow it hit me and I  turned around and I went back and asked that person why did you do that and and she said I wanted to  know what social cues I was putting out and again social cues shouldn't freaking matter but they do  we live in society yes it's like I mean that's where the you know social society these are all  you know I have a couple of other things so so as much as I know I think they're really like  these air real fast you know I have a bunch of things okay well there's a second thing I think it's  really important that to acknowledge that there are no people color this room yes yes absolutely they're  they're we aren't burning man we are burning man no people color I hear and I'm I know for a fact  they're trans people of color out here but but multiple but the the the trans experience is  challenging walking through the world as a person of color is challenging and please make a special  effort not out of pity uh to out of honoring and honor to reach out to trans people of color because  it's a very isolating I'm about to cry actually there's a very isolating and white tears white tears  it's a very isolating experience so please don't talk down to them don't look at them with pity but  oh somebody cut me off please don't talk down to them don't look to look at them with pity but  please see with compassion someone who's potentially an isolation and and and make an effort to say  hi and to emphasize to emphasize your point 80 percent of the anti gay violence is perpetrated  against people who don't fit in gender true 80 percent of that is against trans women of color color  so so um so we're we're going to end the ask a tranny show and the next show coming up you all  are going to be amazed can I can I can I say one thing yes please uh I thank you so much for inviting  me in to do this because that's
