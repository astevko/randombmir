 Y'all want to talk about Octopussy?  Is that what I'm hearing?  Octopussy fingers.  Not even from the James Bond movie.  Literally my fingers are Octopussy fingers.  Octopussy fingers.  These are fingers with long tentacles  and succulent little biscuits on them  that come in and they tickle your face and your shoulders.  And if you want a massage from something  that's across between a shrimp and an Octopussy.  You're in delight mode from the Octopussy.  Winchester is literally the only person here  who has enjoyed my Octopussy fingers.  Wait, I love them.  Oh, you like them too.  I didn't tell you yet because I love them.  Can you remember?  Everyone else thinks they're creepy as hell.  I'm so happy there's a couple people here  who actually enjoy these.  I'm looking forward to a massage  with like several people with Octopussy fingers.  I mean, can you imagine?  It's like, do we have a tickle camp?  I bet I'm sure there's a tickle camp.  There's a one-wear one guide right there.  You probably find one, I'm sure.  Okay, well.  These have suckers on them.  When do you find an Octopussy finger with suckers?  Not very often.  And they're just such a beautiful shade of pink.  And they are.  They're really are.  The shade of pink that makes you wonder  why you're in the Octopussy fingers.  They're a shade of pink that makes you turn the shade of pink.  Oh!  Oh, I got some.  I was gonna do something.  Blues.
