 At the end of the day, as I said earlier, no one has ever been left on the  playa to die. So everyone will get home to die. It rhymes. It's quiet to  die. Well, no, it's all going to be okay. So if you will, you will  eventually get home. Anyway, we've been here for many years. No one has  ever been left on the playa. There is just a gentleman sleeping in our  lounge of which we have not much one of anymore. Right. Exactly.
