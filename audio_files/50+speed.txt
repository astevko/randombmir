 Every year, the lovely Plya Restoration Crew sticks around these parts well after the party is over to clean this wasteland up.  If we don't clean it up, we don't get to have an event.  You do want to have an event next year, don't you?  One of the biggest challenges for the Restoration Crew last year was a degradation of the Plyas surface due to speeding on Gate Road,  which led to deep ruts in the road.  Long story short, don't speed on Gate Road or anywhere else in our fine city.  The speed limit on Gate Road is 10 miles per hour and you can't be pulled over by law enforcement if you go faster.  Want more reasons not to speed on Gate Road?  Fine, speeding causes your tires to churn up more of the Plya surface into dust.  More vehicle speeding equals more dust equals worse condition of the Plya on Gate Road.  The dust created from vehicles driving too fast significantly reduces visibility.  This is dangerous for our gate staff who are working on Gate Road in traffic.  It is also dangerous for other drivers when they cannot see clearly.  Lastly, it tears up your suspension.  So hey, slow down and let's have a good time.  The speed limit on Gate Road is 10 miles per hour and you can't be pulled over by law enforcement if you go faster.
