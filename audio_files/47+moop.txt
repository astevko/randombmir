 Burning Man is the largest, no-trace event in the world, let's keep it that way.  There are no trash cans at Burning Man, sorry Oscar, pack it in, pack it out.  Never let it hit the ground.  Carry a little moop container with you wherever you go, and if you come across any moop, consider  it your moop, and pick up what you see on the ground.  And lead no trace doesn't end at the highway.  On your way home, take your trash and recycling to participating Exodus Trash and Recycling  locations.  Located on every route from Black Rock City, check the materials you got at Creters for locations  and more information.  And hey, the payutes will be accepting Trash and Recycling at the Nixon Store and I-80  Smoke Shop in Wattsworth too.  If we take care of the playa, it'll be here for us next year, and year after that.  Leave no trace on and off the playa.  The future of Burning Man literally depends on it.  94.5  BMIR
