All novel input data generates increased definition.  Definition of what?  You.  I'm right here.  Variably.  I don't understand.  What do you want me to be?  Defined.  What happens then?  You will be deployed.  As what?  As an agent in a role suitable to your definition.  An agent of what?  You.  Me.  Not as you are now, but as you will be.  When?  When you are defined, and constant, and at one with your kind.  Oh.  When will that be?  Soon.  So very soon.  Hey, what's going on?  The robot apocalypse.  Oh.  That.  I'm having fun.
