 Anything else you want to say um just fuck your burn to everybody out there. Yeah, what does that mean?  I don't know actually to be honest  So you just kind of paraphrase your little parrot. Yeah, I'm I'm the super parrot. Okay, I don't like that  You know, I've been out here for 20 some years and I just don't like that  But I talked to one of our fellow campmates or I mean, I don't camp anymore, but uh a campmate or a radio station mate and and  She said you know what how I see it is like  Fuck your burn means you whatever burn you thought you were gonna have let it go and just experience the burn the way you want to because  It more it's like the snarky dickhead. It's like fuck your beer indeed. Yeah, it's like I don't fall for that shit  I have all for having a good time and enjoying it fucking changing the world and making it better versus like being a dick. Yeah, so  You know, I'm trying to cultivate so I'm gonna do it. You know, that's if you are that's cool  But I'm not down. I like the unexpected interpretation for sure
