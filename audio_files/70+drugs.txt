 Hi, Trish. Can I give a shout out to my favorite camp? Yeah. Okay, so my favorite camp is Fandango  I didn't camp there, but there are pure anarchy punks that just are either drunk as shit at their bar or passed out on the seat  Sleeping there. Yeah, and I love them. I asked this guy for a napkin because my friends no started bleeding  He starts looking in his trash can. Oh, your friends no started bleeding. Yeah, he laughed too hard  He's on acid. I don't know what happened. That's we don't condone  This is for parody purposes. Oh, right. We don't drugs on federal airwaves  Anyway, sounds like a good bar. He starts looking in the trash can for a napkin  Then he starts vomiting in the trash can  Keeps looking for  Not condoning vomiting  No, or  What do you call it? Can't do it. What's the regulation term?  For vomiting narcotics. Oh, yeah, no drugs. All drug mentioned on VMware 94.5 FM  The voice of the man the voice of black rock city is for parody purposes only.
