 And we have another young, young member of the city, Cassia is here, she's from  Kidsville. And Cassia would like to tell you what her version of the weather is.  So it's gonna get hot later on today.  How hot do you think? Too hot?  Yeah, too hot.  Probably too hot, too hot to handle.  It's some white outs.  Yeah, it'd be dusty. There's gonna be dust and more dust.
