 And we appreciate all the years you've been coming out here and doing your thing man. No, it's a lie. No, this is  I've been working in radios is like 1975 and  This is by far the most creative radio I've ever done. Yeah. No, this it blows everything out of the water  Completely well, I've worked in public radio commercial radio  Pirate radio. This is this is the shit. Yeah, it really is it really is  Well, I like the aspect that people can just come off the playa  That's a really nice touch to just have the station much like many camps open for people to just come in and just talk to me  This is a total oral experience  You never know what the fuck is gonna come out of these speakers. You know most FM radio stations  Your average commercial station has like 300 songs in rotation. We have 25,000 songs in rotation  Even we're even around automation. I  Never know what I'm going to hear it totally takes me on a trip  Which is what I want to happen in a radio station. Yeah, you want to be taken somewhere else  They want to be taken on the dirt. I don't want to hear my old stuff  I'm gonna be taking on a trip and that's what we do here no doubt and and you add to it actually  You know, I want to say like I thought the phone was a really nice touch this year  Phone was amazing the phone is a real because they just actually have the outside world which usually is very isolated  You can't contact here being able to like call in it was just surreal very surreal
