 This sculpture has a brain-like appearance, standing 15 feet tall on a root-like base structure.  When you get inside, an interactive lighting system creates hundreds of pathways of light,  each dependent on the pathways of others intersecting with it.  Other events can put themselves in this network of steel and light connecting with the art and each other.
