 Kavya, we've just gotten word into the studio that the man's arms have been raised.  The moment we've been waiting for.  The moment we've been waiting for, this is the start of the whole process of burning the man.  So though you have gone up, let's go out to organism in the field and organism.  Can you hear me okay?  We can hear you.  Look how the man, the arms have been raised, right?  Yes, the arms are raised now and the crowd was cheering a little while ago and that happened.  And I'm here with pretty slippery and dragon hips.  Right, and so pretty slippery, how are you doing tonight?  I'm doing great, it's been an awesome burn.  Yeah, so what camp are you with this year?  We're with the living room and we're at 225 in B and we have a big dome and a bunch of couches.  We played music all week with instruments and had yoga and some lectures.  Wow, do you have a piano?  We have a keyboard.  Oh, you do?  Well, I'm so there tonight.  Yeah, you should come over, we're going to be jamming later.
