 Hey, I'd like to talk to you about consent.  What is consent?  Well, consent is crucial in many situations, mind altering substances, photography, and  sexual activity, for example.  Sexual consent is an agreement between people about what should and should not take place in  a sexual situation.  Now consent is the bare minimum required for legal and ethical sexual activity.  Consent requires people to be 18 and over, properly informed, not under coercion, and  insufficiently sober.  If you're not sure about any of these factors, then you cannot assume consent has been given.  Silence is not consent.  Nudity is not consent.  Drunk, not consent.  A sleep is not consent.  Only a clearly expressed yes is consent, and consent can be withdrawn at any time.  To be sure about consent, communication is necessary.  Now we get it, communicating about sexual consent can be scary.  Any of us are afraid it's going to be uncomfortable or awkward, or we're going to be rejected.  But communication is absolutely essential.  Talk to your prospective partners or friends about your desires and your boundaries.  Some people like to say that they have no boundaries, but in reality they probably do and just  may not know what they are until they're crossed.  Always be prepared to renegotiate boundaries if they have been crossed, and don't interact  with anyone who is not interested in your desires and boundaries.  Really.
