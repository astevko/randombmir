 Black Rock Airport.  This is an important announcement from the Black Rock City Airport about driving to the airport.  Please don't drive to the f***ing damn f***ing airport.  Only permitted and mutant vehicles are allowed to drive to the airport.  All others will be turned away.  But don't worry, there's an airport shuttle that operates throughout the day beginning August 25th through September 3rd.  Shuttles will depart regularly throughout the day during airport operating hours and take participants to the 2 and 10 o'clock sides with stops along the way.  Flying out of Black Rock City, you must check in at least 45 minutes before your flight.  And finally, please don't announce that there are scenic flights available at Black Rock Airport.  We cannot handle the masses and they cannot handle the disappointment when they're turned away.  So pretty, pretty, pretty please with a cherry on top.  Don't announce there are scenic flights available at the airport.  Thank you.
