 The reason that Tommy would call up your wife every single day, Antella, that he loved her and your children, is because his mother never told him that he loved him.  And so he wanted to make sure that every day of his life that the people he really loved, he would call up seven times a fricking day and tell him that he loved him.  Even if you didn't answer the God damn phone, he would call you up and say, you know, Mel, I really love you. I love your kids. I love your dog.  Well, yes, Tommy, but you know what? It's the most sincere love that you can get from Verizon.
