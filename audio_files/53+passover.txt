 I am Lieutenant Luis Ayelazapate with the Nevada Highway Patrol.  In 2017, I was nearly involved in a head-on collision with the participant who crossed  the EWL line in Nevada State Highway 447 to pass slower vehicles due to an excess.  Every year during this event, I deal with crashes for assault and for persistent speeding, driving  unsafely, or losing control of an over-load of vehicles.  I understand you want to get to the event, and when it's over, get home.  It's not worth putting your life or others at risk, just to save a few minutes.  There are a few tips to ensure you drive to and from the event is uneven.  First, observe the speed limits.  This should be a given.  It is even more important if you're driving a heavy loaded vehicle or one you're unfamiliar  with like a rental.  Two, don't pass long-line vehicles.  This can be deceiving.  If you miss charging camera on common traffic, you go on to force other drivers to take the  base direction so you can get back in line.  There, if you're tirelessly the pullover rest, it only takes us a moment of inattention to  drive off the road and just control of a vehicle.  Sport.  If you see an emergency vehicle with light flashing, slow down, and pull over regardless of  what direction you're headed, fit.  If you're driving at the dark, watch for life's back on the road, swarming to avoid a cow  off any results, and drivers lose control of their vehicles.  In six, please worry you keep close at all times, you never know when you're going to need  it.  And we say also, put that within the right hour of the call, thank you.
