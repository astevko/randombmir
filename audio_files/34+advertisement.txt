 We are pleased to present an example of decommodification, sharing with friends is good.  Brand names are intrusive and intrinsically greedy.  That goes for your rental trucks, trailers, and anything else that advances a commercial  motive.  We don't need any advertising on our landscape in Black Rock City.  Get some gaffer tape.  Get clever.  Insult them if you can.  Let's make the world really real.
