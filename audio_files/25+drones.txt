 The United States Treasury Department presents the Adventures of Superman.  It's a drone and it better not be yours.  This is Superman. Here to tell you that the only drones out here have been pre-registered.  If you try to fly a drone without having registered it first, you might find it confiscated  and yourself given a super expensive ticket by the BLM. And sorry, you can't register one out here.  It's all done in advance. Not even Superman can help you.  Not that I'd be inclined to. Drones are worse than pigeons. And if you think pigeon droppings are a problem, trust me, you don't want to scare Superman.  We're ending battle for truth, justice, and the American way.
