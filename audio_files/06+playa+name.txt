 Do you want a new plyo name? Do you want to be insulted by a sassy Scottish robot?  Do you want daft punk to sit on your trash fence? Me too. Come to break away Republic at 4.15  and do, and look for a drunk Scottish robot. Stop for a drink at the bar, and be terrified by  a lounge filled with a hundred sexually charged and morally ambiguous turbos. That's 4.15 and gonorrhea.  Free insults and new plyo names from a drunk Scottish robot, terrifying jibbles and very shitty  booze. 4.15 and gonorrhea. Poop.
