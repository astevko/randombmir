 I'm telling you, it's not here.  It must have fallen out of my bike basket.  Damn it!  Oh, maybe you left it at this stretch.  I am totally screwed!  Wait, you lost something at Burning Man?  I am shocked!  No, stuff never goes missing here, because after all, we're all well rested and clear-headed  and we pretty much stay in one place the whole time and everything is totally brightly lit  and the weather's always nice and the crowds are pretty small.  But hey, at least you labeled your stuff, right?  Because that way, there's a much better chance it'll find its way back to you.  Luggage tag and graving, stencil, duct tape and sharpie, whatever.  Just get your name and camp address on there.  One simple rule.  If you want it back, label it.  You did label it, right?  Shade.  Are you at tightsly screwed?  95.5, BMIR.
