 You came from beneath the sock, crusty, cracked, and thirsting for vengeance.  It's only one step behind you, and it's coming for your soul.  Enter a heel, enter an instant.  You'll beg for mercy when you go toe to toe, with playa foot.  The black rock desert is a harsh environment, and few body parts bear the brunt of it, no other than our feet.  The most common foot injury, playa foot.  Essentially, it's a chemical burn caused by the alkaline soil of the playa.  Fun?  It's gonna hurt like hell, and takes forever to heal.  So here's an idea.  Let's not get it.  Cool?  The simplest way to prevent it is to cover your feet with clean socks and closed shoes.  But if you just gotta wear those sparkly open toe platforms, when you get back to camp, wash your feet.  Preferably with an acidic solution, one part vinegar to three parts water.  Then the lotion up your feet, and put on some clean socks.  Bam, you good as new.  Or you can go for the chemical burns.  It's up to you.
