 Who are the VIPs at Burning Man?  They're the artists, the makers, the tens of thousands of volunteers.  The people who make this city, the beautiful, living, breathing, entity that it is.  I guess who those people are.  They're you.  We're in this together.  We're all volunteers, so step in and step up, whether it's your first burn or your tenth.  The best way to feel connected as a citizen of BlackRock City is to join others to help make something happen.  One of the easiest ways to meet new people and try new things is to drop by the V-Spot,  apply it info in Center Camp.  They keep a list of volunteer opportunities.  There are always people who need help and for most, no special skills are required.  And being a VIP can be as simple as helping a neighbor set up their camp.  So come on, what are you waiting for?
