 BMI-R94.5  Okay, we all know Burning Man is a big deal.  Big camps, big events, big ideas, big vehicles, big art,  and a big population in one of the biggest open spaces in the world.  It's easy to get swept up by the bigness of it all.  But consider this, bigger isn't always better.  Amidst all the spectacular bigness,  there are thousands of smaller wonders and human-sized miracles all over the playa.  Things you'll miss out on if you're only gazing up at the gargantuan.  Smaller projects can provide a unique and intimate experience you can't get with the mammoth works.  And many take just as much creativity and effort as the larger scale ones.  Burning Man is about what you contribute.  The interactivity you bring, the art you create.  You don't need a six-figure budget and a big crew.  Think about it.  Many of today's biggest theme camps and best known artists started small.  The seeds of future year's spectacles are germinating right now.  All over the playa and in the back streets of Black Rock City.  Right under your nose and under the radar.  So ask yourself, when you explore a city,  do you only stick to the main thoroughfares and the big attractions?  Or do you search out the road less traveled?  When you look back at your photos from Burning Man, how many feature the big art?  This year, challenge yourself to find the unexpected, the smaller,  the lower-budget expressions of art.  Give a big thank you to the artists.  Invite an artist to create a small installation for the frontage of your camp.  And if you're looking to engage your kids at Burning Man,  ask them defined examples of small, inspiring art on the playa.  Burning Man is a city full of wonders, big and small.  This year, let's appreciate them all.
