 You know, it was an interesting year for pieces out on Playa.  I was really kind of amazed by, I believe it was called the Longview Polar Bear.  I think it came out of, I think it was an Oakland project, but I can probably check on that.  It was a 60-foot tall polar bear out on the Playa, a 35-foot tall polar bear.  I'm sorry, not on the Playa, made of car hoods.  And it was meant to talk about climate change and talk about the polar bears placed in the world  and how their place in the world is kind of displacing the polar bears with climate change.  But it was an amazing piece, it was lit up spectacularly at night, there were projections on it.  It was a very beautiful piece, very well done.
