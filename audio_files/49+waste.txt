 Leave No Trace doesn't begin on the playa.  It applies on the way to and from Burning Man as well.  Burning Man's got several complaints from Persian County about participants peeing  and pooping on the side of Highway 447 during the drive-in.  Folks, this isn't cool.  Good burners are good neighbors.  It's not your bathroom, it's their home.  We know traffic jams can result in long waits, but if you have to go, bring a lidded bucket  or other sealable container along and get rid of the waste appropriately.
