 Congratulations, you've finally made it to Black Rock City.  So what happens now? Well, that depends on when you got here.  See, the Burning Man Gate opens at 1201 Sunday, August 26th.  But the event doesn't officially start until 6 p.m. Sunday.  We open the gate early to allow you to have time to build your camp  and otherwise prepare for the official event start.  So, please use the time until the official 6 p.m. start to prepare.  And don't start partying until the official start time.  There'll be plenty of time to crack a cold one once you get camp set up.
