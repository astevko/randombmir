 BMI-R, 94.5  Electric bikes have come a long way in the last few years.  We're seeing a lot more of them and other kinds of e-powered personal transportation on the playa, which is great.  What's not great is that we're also seeing a lot of people speeding around the playa unsafely at high speeds.  And a lot more accidents and injuries.  We don't want to make more rules, but we may be forced to if we can't get participants to operate their electric bikes safely.  So, be responsible. The speed limit, even for electric powered bikes, is 5 miles per hour.  Even if you're doing the speed limit, drive safely around other participants and be considerate.  And if you see someone riding unsafely, encourage them to slow down. Be safe out there.
