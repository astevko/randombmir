 So and now with the weather today is Friday where it's sunny high of 83 winds on northwest at 5 to 10 miles per hour  Hopefully we get a little more of those clouds. We had this morning, but tonight  It's forecasted to be a clear sky with a low 49 wins light and variable  I guess that means lower than 5 miles per hour. It's the first time I've seen that on the forecast Saturday mainly sunny sky  High of 87 winds out of the northeast at 5 to 10 miles per hour Saturday night clear skies low of 49 wins at the northeast at 5 to 10 miles  Pawa Sunday. It's getting a little toaster higher on 90 with winds about 5 to 10 and Sunday night  More of the same with a low of 50. So yeah, looks like gray weather. Gonna warm up a little bit on Sunday and  I'm grateful for that
