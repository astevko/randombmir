 Yeah, so that was a theme from Tetris, followed by a tune from Mega Man 2, that was Dr.  Wiley's castle that's kind of like boss level near the end of the game.  That game has some great music, it's one of the most popular soundtracks ever, with good  reason.  There's some interesting thing about Chiptune era music here is that there's all these  kind of interesting sound ship programming techniques that go into making the music more  exciting because you have this really kind of simple digital synthesizer, and if you wanted  to do cool sounding things, like we all enjoy in this era of post-recorded music where,  yeah, you can do anything with sound.  If they wanted to do something like in that song, you heard like kind of echoing sounds,  you hear the melody and it would be echoed, and they actually would like program the synthesizer  just to repeat every single note, but quieter or something like that to make echoes.  Anywho, it's all fascinating to me to hear the art created within limitations, especially  when you know the limitations.
