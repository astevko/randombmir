 What were the circumstances that led up to you as a group deciding to come out to Burning Man and bring this piece here?  I mean, this is a wonderful thing.  The theme of Burning Man this year is eye robot and I went, you must be kidding.  And they won't.  No.  So I just jumped at the chance, I said, do any bands play that?  But we are apparently the first band ever with full production to ever play here.  So we're rather proud of that.  No, I can't wait.  The lights might leave a little bit to be desired, but hopefully the sound will all work fine.  That's a good answer for us.
