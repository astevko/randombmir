 Ah, late August. That time of year where we start saying goodbye to summer and welcome  in the new semester, what better way to prepare than by clearing up that warped mind of  yours with BRCU, the Black Rock Center for unlearning. Come unlearn the meaning of  motorboat Monday while sipping specialty cocktails from our 24-7 bar. Be sure to stop by the  genital appreciation station and follow that up with one of our events. Learn about the  anatomy of consent on Tuesday from 1-230 in state till trivia from 8-10. Friday we're  showing love to our neighbors up north with a Canada Day celebration from 12-4 and  rest assured we'll have ample amounts of snark and sass all week long. BRCU located at 4  and E.
