 Sirees of the Dust  Hey guys, I'm Robin. I'm Story. And this is our first burn. It was it was a little bit like nerve-wracking because I'm a single mom  And I brought my daughter here and we were supposed to meet up with some of our friends. Yeah, whom we have not found yet  and tell them about your experience with bicycle riding. I've always wanted to ride a bicycle in my life, but I grew up in the worst place to do it. So it didn't. And this is my first time riding a bicycle.  Yeah, so Story got to learn how to ride a bicycle on a first burn, which is pretty exciting.  Come by BMIR between noon and four to record an entry in our diary.
