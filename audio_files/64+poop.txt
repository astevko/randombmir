 So, another one is falling.  Just roll about to another pooping camp this morning.  If you're listening right now and you're planning on  pooping in a camp, think again.  It's not nice.  No, no, no, no.  Okay, so the first year, four years ago,  it happened in one of our campmates,  so the water catcher from their shower.  Oh, God.  So someone pooped in that.  And then three years ago,  someone pooped between two of our campmates RVs  and trailers or whatever,  and covered it up with a little cooler.  So someone picked up this cooler,  and there was poop there.  And today, I woke up or went to bed, I don't know.  And someone had like pooped,  kind of like off of the corner of our cooler,  like our, my family is my cooler, Lena.  There's sweet off to the ground.  Yeah, and then like, yeah, so it was like on the cooler,  and on the handle, and on the ground.  And I was like, wow.  So apparently they're eating a lot of fiber.  Good for you.  You're crushing it.  However, yeah, but at the same time,  like if somebody is pushed to that point,  where they're like crawling under somebody's like,  you know, large truck.  It wasn't a little over camp.  Well, wherever it happens to be,  like you crawl away like a sick animal,  and you know, you have to do that.  Like, somebody is in a really bad place,  and that's their choice.  Or someone's messing with us.  You know, like badly.  You know, you get upset about it,  your buddies in a really bad place.  Oh, you know, I mean,  we were talking about this in camp  because we had one of those little,  you know, somebody dropped a doose  under our big box truck last year,  and we didn't find it until  we dropped a doose,  well, you know,  where do we start?  But you know, it just had this moment where like,  it's like, okay, somebody's got to pick it up.  We feel a sense of revulsion,  but then it's like almost immediately the sort of the pity,  went through like crawling under a car to drop a deuce.
