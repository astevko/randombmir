 I want to talk to you for a second about bike safety around mutant vehicles.  There are a few things you can do to make sure you and your friends don't get hurt when  you're out and about on the playa.  First, try to stay at least 15 feet away from a moving mutant vehicle or water or fuel  truck.  Don't race in front of or circle a moving mutant vehicle, and don't buzz or hitch a toe  on a moving mutant vehicle either.  Remember, if you can't see the driver, he or she probably can't see you, and we say this  every year.  If you're riding your bike at night, light it up.
