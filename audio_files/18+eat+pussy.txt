 So, I have a very important question for you, Donkey Show.  I would love to answer it.  Would you ever eat pussy?  In the apocalypse, say the world ends,  there are certain things I would eat that I wouldn't want to eat.  The first thing would be chickens.  I own eight chickens.  I would kill four of them.  I would keep the other four alive for their eggs.  The second thing I would do is I would kill my roommates pussy  and I would eat it.  Wow.  Do you like this pussy?  You know, I really do.  I do like this pussy.  Yeah.  It's a good pussy.  I call it Bakunin, that's its name.  And I would slay it.  I would slay Bakunin the pussy and I would eat it.  Yeah, I guess when it really comes down to it, the apocalypse.  You know, you kind of have to make those choices.  Oh, it's just survival.  So, how do you think the pussy would taste?  Tough.  Yeah.  They're probably tough.  Just by looking at it, it looks like a dry burger patty.  This is an ugly cat I'm talking about.  Yeah, I don't think it would taste good, but honestly, you got to do what you got to do to stay alive.  I really got to do what you got to do.  Yeah.
