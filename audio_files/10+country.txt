 Contra dance near center camp at 6.30 on electro, every night, with high energy live acoustic  music by counter current and guests.  Dancers flow with and around each other in long lines creating a human kaleidoscope.  Contra may be the easiest and most accessible group dance form.  Moose are simple and repeat, so there are many chances to learn the patterns with your  fellow dancers guiding you.  The Zen is the flow from one move to the next.  If you're smiling, you're doing it right.  You can include yelling and stomping, creative embellishments, playful silliness, it's tribal  and hypnotic.  Week nights from 8 to 11, and check out our Waltz yoga and music jam sessions weekday,  mostly in the morning.  Join us in our big dance tent on our nice wood dance floor.
