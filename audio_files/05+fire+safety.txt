 Here's some important information you need to know about new guidelines for the burns.  The burn perimeters may be held longer than in previous years in order to let the heat  get down to a manageable level.  Please do not enter a burn circle.  You will be asked to move back into the crowd.  Remember, you are responsible for your own actions and to support those around you.  Get to know those around you.  Introduce yourself.  And if someone seems to be having a really, really bad day, call for help immediately.  The perimeter volunteer in front of you is connected to all the civic services of BlackRock  City, including medical and the Rangers.  They have people on call 24-7 who can provide judgment-free help through a difficult,  physical, emotional, or psychological experience.  All you need to do is ask them for help.  This goes double for anyone you see in distress after the burn ends and everyone starts leaving.  If someone next to you starts talking about rushing the fire, you can engage them calmly  and clearly.  You can tell them that every time we burn art, we are proving to the world that we can do  this safely.  And every time someone behaves unsafely at a burn, it puts the future of burning man in jeopardy.  If they listen, great, you've done the city of service.  But if they make moves towards the perimeter, point them out to a perimeter volunteer right  away.  And if they wander off, tell a perimeter person about the conversation, including details on  the person's appearance.  Do not try to physically restrain that person and definitely do not put yourself in harm's  way.  Point them out and let the perimeter team take it from there.  And finally, please keep tabs on your children.  Every year we get reports of families getting separated at the big burns.  Let's help each other stay safe out there.
