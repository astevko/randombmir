 Hi, this is Paul Joe and I'm excited to tell you about our theme camp.  Ballroom dancing and emergency replacement batteries, what a winning combination.  Come visit the WTF Ballroom and Battery Exchange Camp.  We are proud to provide both a cool activity and a cool service for all of our burner friends.  Did you ever want to learn ballroom dancing?  Here's your chance.  Our WTF, oh by the way, WTF means Walt's Tango and Foxtrot Ballroom instructors will teach  you the very basic moves for the most popular ballroom dances.  But wait, did you forget to turn off those LED lights last night and now you're in desperate  need of AA, AAA, CD or 9 volt batteries?  Well look no more, come on over for replacements.  It's important that we dispose of all used batteries so we kindly ask that you bring your dead  ones with you.  We're located at 6.15 and Iron Man and our hours are Monday through Thursday from 11.30  a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and from 3.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.  Looking forward to seeing you, bye.
