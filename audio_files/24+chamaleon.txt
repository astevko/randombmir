 I'll see you in the next one.  Come Million by Ram Wiesenstern and Amit Wiesenstern.  Chameleon's change of color is mostly known for its camouflage function.  The artist choose to focus on the lesser known aspect.  It's also used by chameleons to reflect their moods and intentions by sending social signals  to neighboring chameleons.  The 50-foot-long 20-foot-high chameleon gets this of a metal skeleton as a frame, which  will be covered in LED panels.  Inside the chameleon, above participants, the heart will be placed.  Next to the heart and connected to the spine, there will be a set of handles that can be  pulled, each one a different color.  The heart's skin and handles will interact with the visitors and will enable the chameleon  to shine in beautiful colors and patterns.  The signals will use and to those outside when you display your colors.
