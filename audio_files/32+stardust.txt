 Stargast by Stephanie Page-Toshner.  The artist was moved to inspiration, watching thousands of roast swifts.  A bird swirled around and down into the top of a school chimney.  It's a longstanding tradition to sit on the lawn of the school with hundreds of people  and watch the birds gather and dive until the last swift disappears.  As the artist watched this, she was inspired and the next morning,  the vision of that vortex kept popping back into her head.  How could she recreate the movement?  Could it make people feel the same way she did when seeing no swifts?  The vision morphed into a more celestial realm.  She saw stars and planets replacing the dots of birds in the vortex.  Stardust has a spaceship-looking base surrounded by flying saucer benches.  The benches pulse with LED lights.  A metallic modelist extends upwards that houses the cosmic rays that create the light show.  Can you find the secret levers that initiate the celestial mechanics and send a cascade of  shooting stars toward the vault of heaven?
