 Hi, I'm Rat Lady from Mobility Camp. We're located in center camp plaza right in between 11 of  and the lamp lighters at 4.30. We are a camp that takes out disabled and that includes elderly  pregnant, anything that inhibits your ability to walk out into the playa or bike out on your own.  We work on a worst-come-first serve basis, so able-bodied are welcome, but you could be bumped if  somebody wears off need your spot. Our tours go out at 5.45 in 9 a.m., 6.9 p.m., except on the  major burn nights and we will take folks out to the burns. Again, that's Mobility Camp located  in center camp plaza at 4.30 in between 11 of and the lamp lighters.
