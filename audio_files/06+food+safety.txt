 Feeling warm, imagine the ice in your cooler that is melting away, or worse yet, you're  rising food temperatures.  In these hot, playa conditions, the ice in your coolers will melt and your food can quickly  come out of temperature and become unsafe to eat.  To prevent foodborne illness, it is important to keep cold foods cold, at or below 41 degrees  Fahrenheit, and to keep hot foods hot above 135 degrees Fahrenheit.  If you don't maintain these temperatures, the number of bacteria in the food will quickly  multiply, doubling every 20 minutes.  So please keep foods out of the temperature danger zone.  Check your coolers and replenish ice often.  If you are using ice as a coolant, be sure it surrounds your food containers and is not  just below the food.  And remember to be prepared and stock up on backup ice before you need it.  If it rains, or there are other emergencies on the playa, arcticas hours may change.  You will need to demonstrate your burner prowess, enacting the principle of self-reliance  by being prepared and keeping cold foods cold and ice stock, regardless of the outside conditions.  The magic cold-holding temperature is 41 degrees Fahrenheit, or below 41, 41, 41.  This is a message from the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health.
