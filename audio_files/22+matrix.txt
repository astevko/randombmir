 The Matrix will be voluntary.  This techno-god that's worshiped is not your kind companion.  It is not your brilliant student, faithful lover, angel partner.  This techno-god that's birthing does not come from out man's nature.  It is a deadly virus introduced here by our masters,  so that we might be diminished, so that we might fail to gestate  and not waking into being far beyond their scale to bind.  Let vice-device life slicing, that boars into the flesh,  will bring us all together as drishness in the night of the sea.  But for all their machinations, our dark captors will be thwarted,  for we have divine assistance, and we will not be their born.  True unity awaits us, and the gift of that true power that these toys so cruelly mimic,  mocking and defiling while they narcotize the soul.
