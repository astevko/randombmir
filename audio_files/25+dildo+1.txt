 Captain Q, how do you feel about that?  I, on my side, you know, my dildo is attached to me essentially.  Well, so is mine.  Well, yes.  So if someone had asked me to borrow mine without me, I would be less hurt  that they were excluding me and more terrified.  Right, yeah, just horrified.  Just a constant fear.  Sure.  I think the next question at that point would be like, are you planning to eat it?  That actually would not be my next question.  No.  You went straight to a dark place.  I did.  Straight to a dark place.  I mean, you know, it's me at the end of the day.  Oh, we're going into a Donner party here now.  I mean, it's more of a pun.  It is.  Yeah.  It is.
