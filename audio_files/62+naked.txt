 So this is my first burn and one of the things I wanted to do was to walk around naked.  It never been naked in public and that sounded very interesting to me.  I decided to do it but it was spontaneous.  I hadn't set out on the walk intending to be naked so but then I took off all my clothes  and kept walking and so I didn't have extra sunscreen.  I wasn't thinking about it but as I was walking by I really liked that people weren't staring  at me and I felt very safe even though I was fully naked and I thought it's great  nobody even notices.  And then a guy in a camp said hey you look like you could use some more sun protection  and he handed me a parasol and I thought that is the kind of way that I want my nakedness  to be noticed.  He noticed and it was in a way that was caring and I really appreciated it.  Come by BMIR between noon and four to record an entry in our diary.
