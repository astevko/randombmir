 Sam come on  Sam  Sam are you staring at his wiener?  What? No I'm not!  Yeah you were!  You were staring at Zach's dick!  No I was staring at something past his dick.  No you were staring right at his penis.  So, so what if I was?  He's right, it's kind of nice.  Oh my god.  Squaresville!  Timmy shut up.  Kinda looks like a big tuba cookie dough.  Yeah, oh god!  Well he's kinda right, it does look like that.  You know what it kinda looks like?  It looks like the trunk of a majestic redwood.  Yeah, with veins.  Yeah.  It kinda looks like a sleepy baby seal.  I'll snow load up in a sleeping bag.  Yeah, with veins.  You know what it reminds me of?  Summertime.  Yeah!  Oh gross!  You know I think looking at it is kind of like looking at your favorite song.  Does that make sense?  No I guess not.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh my god!  Squaresville!  Population 3.  Do you guys want to see my penis do a trick?  Yes, we do.  Okay, okay.
